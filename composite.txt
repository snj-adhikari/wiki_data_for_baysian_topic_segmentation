Capella , designated α Aurigae (Latinized to Alpha Aurigae, abbreviated Alpha Aur, α Aur), is the brightest star in the constellation of Auriga, the sixth-brightest star in the night sky, and the third-brightest in the northern celestial hemisphere after Arcturus and Vega.A prominent object in the northern winter sky, it is circumpolar to observers north of 44°N.Its name meaning "little goat" in Latin, Capella depicted the goat Amalthea that suckled Zeus in classical mythology.Capella is relatively close, at only 42.9 light-years (13.2 pc) from the Sun.Although it appears to be a single star to the naked eye, Capella is actually a quadruple star system organized in two binary pairs, made up of the stars Capella Aa, Capella Ab, Capella H, and Capella L.   
The primary pair, Capella Aa and Capella Ab, are two bright yellow giant stars, both of which are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun.The secondary pair, Capella H and Capella L, are around 10,000 astronomical units (AU) from the first and are two faint, small and relatively cool red dwarfs.Capella Aa and Capella Ab have exhausted their core hydrogen, and cooled and expanded, moving off the main sequence.They are in a very tight circular orbit about 0.74 AU apart, and orbit each other every 104 days.Capella Aa is the cooler and more luminous of the two with spectral class K0III; it is 78.7 ± 4.2 times the Sun's luminosity and 11.98 ± 0.57 times its radius.An ageing red clump star, Capella Aa is fusing helium to carbon and oxygen in its core.Capella Ab is slightly smaller and hotter and of spectral class G1III; it is 72.7 ± 3.6 times as luminous as the Sun and 8.83 ± 0.33 times its radius.It is in the Hertzsprung gap, corresponding to a brief subgiant evolutionary phase as it expands and cools to become a red giant.Capella is one of the brightest X-ray sources in the sky, thought to come primarily from the corona of Capella Aa.Several other stars in the same visual field have been catalogued as companions but are physically unrelated.-- -- Nomenclature  -- --
α Aurigae (Latinised to Alpha Aurigae) is the star system's Bayer designation.It also has the Flamsteed designation 13 Aurigae.It is listed in several multiple star catalogues as ADS 3841, CCDM J05168+4559, and WDS J05167+4600.As a relatively nearby star system, Capella is listed in the Gliese-Jahreiss Catalogue with designations GJ 194 for the bright pair of giants and GJ 195 for the faint pair of red dwarfs.The traditional name Capella is Latin for (small) female goat; the alternative name Capra was more commonly used in classical times.In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars.

"O Come, All Ye Faithful" (originally written in Latin as Adeste Fideles) is a Christmas carol that has been attributed to various authors, including John Francis Wade (1711–1786), John Reading (1645–1692), King John IV of Portugal (1604–1656), and anonymous monks.The earliest printed version is in a book published by Wade, but the earliest manuscript bears the name of King John IV, and is located in the library of the Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa.A manuscript by Wade, dating to 1751, is held by Stonyhurst College in Lancashire.The original four verses of the hymn were extended to a total of eight, and these have been translated into many languages.The English translation of "O Come, All Ye Faithful" by the English Catholic priest Frederick Oakeley, written in 1841, is widespread in most English-speaking countries.-- -- Text  -- --
The original text of the hymn has been from time to time attributed to various groups and individuals, including St. Bonaventure in the 13th century or King John IV of Portugal in the 17th, though it was more commonly believed that the text was written by Cistercian monks – the German, Portuguese or Spanish provinces of that order having at various times been credited.In modern English hymnals, the text is usually credited to John Francis Wade, whose name appears on the earliest printed versions.However, this is most likely an error of attribution.Wade, an English Catholic, lived in exile in France and made a living as a copyist of musical manuscripts which he found in libraries.He often signed his copies, possibly because his calligraphy was so beautiful that his clients requested this.In 1751 he published a printed compilation of his manuscript copies, Cantus Diversi pro Dominicis et Festis per annum.This is the first printed source for Adeste Fideles.The version published by Wade consisted of four Latin verses.But later in the 18th century, the French Catholic priest Jean-François-Étienne Borderies (fr) wrote an additional three verses in Latin; these are normally printed as the third to fifth of seven verses.Another anonymous, additional Latin verse is rarely printed.The text has been translated innumerable times into English.The most common version today is a combination of one of Frederick Oakeley's translations of the original four verses, and William Thomas Brooke's translation of the three additional verses.It was first published in Murray's Hymnal in 1852.Oakeley originally titled the song "Ye Faithful, approach ye" when it was sung at his Margaret Church in Marylebone (London), before it was altered to its current form.The song was sometimes referred to as the "Portuguese Hymn" after the Duke of Leeds, in 1795, heard a version of it sung at the Portuguese embassy in London.The most commonly named Portuguese author is King John IV of Portugal, "The Musician King" (reigned 1640–1656).John was a patron of music and the arts, and a considerably sophisticated writer on music; and he was also a composer.During his reign he collected one of the largest musical libraries in the world, which was destroyed in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.He also founded a Music School in Vila Viçosa that "exported" musicians to Spain and Italy.

The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Capella for this star.It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.The catalogue of star names lists Capella as applying to the star α Aurigae Aa.-- -- Observational history  -- --
Capella was the brightest star in the night sky from 210,000 years ago to 160,000 years ago, at about −1.8 in apparent magnitude.At −1.1, Aldebaran was brightest before this period; it and Capella were situated rather close to each other in the sky and approximated boreal pole stars at the time.Capella is thought to be mentioned in an Akkadian inscription dating to the 20th century BC.Its goat-associated symbolism dates back to Mesopotamia as a constellation called "GAM", "Gamlum" or "MUL.GAM" in the 7th-century BC document MUL.APIN.GAM represented a scimitar or crook and may have represented the star alone or the constellation of Auriga as a whole.Later, Bedouin astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal.The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology.It is sometimes called the Shepherd's Star in English literature.Capella was seen as a portent of rain in classical times.Building J of the pre-Columbian site Monte Albán in Oaxaca state in Mexico was built around 275 BC, at a different orientation to other structures in the complex.Its steps are aligned perpendicular to the rising of Capella at that time, so that a person looking out a doorway on the building would have faced it directly.Capella is significant as its heliacal rising took place within a day of the Sun passing directly overhead over Monte Albán.-- -- -- Multiple status  -- -- --
Professor William Wallace Campbell of the Lick Observatory announced that Capella was binary in 1899, based on spectroscopic observations—he noted on photographic plates taken from August 1896 to February 1897 that a second spectrum appeared superimposed over the first, and that there was a doppler shift to violet in September and October and to red in November and February—showing that the components were moving toward and away from the Earth (and hence orbiting each other).Almost simultaneously, British astronomer Hugh Newall had observed its composite spectrum with a four prism spectroscope attached to a 25 inches (64 cm) telescope at Cambridge in July 1899, concluding that it was a binary star system.Many observers tried to discern the component stars without success.Known as "The Interferometrist's Friend", it was first resolved interferometrically in 1919 by John Anderson and Francis Pease at Mount Wilson Observatory, who published an orbit in 1920 based on their observations.This was the first interferometric measurement of any object outside the Solar System.A high-precision orbit was published in 1994 based on observations by the Mark III Stellar Interferometer, again at Mount Wilson Observatory.Capella also became the first astronomical object to be imaged by a separate element optical interferometer when it was imaged by the Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope in September 1995.In 1914, Finnish astronomer Ragnar Furuhjelm observed that the spectroscopic binary had a faint companion star, which, as its proper motion was similar to that of the spectroscopic binary, was probably physically bound to it.

It was at John's Vila Viçosa palace that two manuscripts of the "Portuguese Hymn" have been found and dated to 1640.These manuscripts predate Wade's eighteenth-century versions, whether printed or manuscript.(However, McKim and Randell nonetheless argue for Wade's authorship of the version people are now familiar with.)Among King John's writings is a Defense of Modern Music (Lisbon, 1649).In the same year (1649) he had a huge struggle to get instrumental music approved by the Vatican for use in the Catholic Church.Another famous composition of his is a setting of the Crux fidelis, a work that remains highly popular during Lent among church choirs.-- -- Tune  -- --
Besides John Francis Wade, the tune has been attributed to several musicians, from John Reading and his son, to Handel, and even the German composer Gluck.The Portuguese composer Marcos Portugal or King John IV of Portugal have also been credited.Thomas Arne, whom Wade knew, is another possible composer.There are several similar musical themes written around that time, though it can be hard to determine whether these were written in imitation of the hymn, whether the hymn was based on them, or whether they are totally unconnected.-- -- Published versions  -- --

The hymn was first published by John Francis Wade in his collection Cantus Diversi (1751), with four Latin verses, and music set in the traditional square notation used for medieval liturgical music.It was published again in the 1760 edition of Evening Offices of the Church.It also appeared in Samuel Webbe's An Essay on the Church Plain Chant (1782).The hymn tune also made its way to the Sacred Harp tradition, appearing as "Hither Ye Faithful, Haste with Songs of Triumph" in an 1860 collection.-- -- Lyrics  -- --
These are the original four Latin verses as published by Wade, along with their English translation by Frederick Oakeley.These are the additional Latin verses composed in the 18th century, with English prose translations, not from Oakeley:


 -- -- -- Jacobite connection  -- -- --
The words of the hymn have been interpreted as a Jacobite birth ode to Bonnie Prince Charlie.Professor Bennett Zon, head of music at Durham University, has interpreted it this way, claiming that the secret political code was decipherable by the "faithful" (the Jacobites), with "Bethlehem" a common Jacobite cipher for England and Regem Angelorum a pun on Angelorum (Angels) and Anglorum (English).Wade had fled to France after the Jacobite rising of 1745 was crushed.From the 1740s to 1770s the earliest forms of the carol commonly appeared in English Roman Catholic liturgical books close to prayers for the exiled Old Pretender.In the books by Wade it was often decorated with Jacobite floral imagery, as were other liturgical texts with coded Jacobite meanings.-- -- Performance  -- --
In performance, verses are often omitted – either because the hymn is too long in its entirety or because the words are unsuitable for the day on which they are sung.

In February 1936, Carl L. Stearns observed that this companion appeared to be double itself; this was confirmed in September that year by Gerard Kuiper.This pair are designated Capella H and L.


 -- -- -- X-ray source  -- -- --
Two Aerobee-Hi rocket flights on September 20, 1962, and March 15, 1963, detected and confirmed an X-ray source in Auriga at RA  05h 09m Dec +45°, identified as Capella.Stellar X-ray astronomy started on April 5, 1974, with the detection of X-rays from Capella.A rocket flight on that date briefly calibrated its attitude control system when a star sensor pointed the payload axis at Capella.During this period, X-rays in the range 0.2–1.6 keV were detected by an X-ray reflector system co-aligned with the star sensor.The X-ray luminosity (Lx) of ~1024 W (1031 erg s−1) is four orders of magnitude above the Sun's X-ray luminosity.Capella's X-rays are thought to be primarily from the corona of the more massive star.Capella is ROSAT X-ray source 1RXS J051642.2+460001.The high temperature of Capella's corona as obtained from the first coronal X-ray spectrum of Capella using HEAO 1 would require magnetic confinement, unless it is a free-flowing coronal wind.-- -- Observation  -- --

With an average apparent magnitude of +0.08, Capella is the brightest object in the constellation Auriga, the sixth-brightest star in the night sky, the third-brightest in the northern celestial hemisphere (after Arcturus and Vega), and the fourth-brightest visible to the naked eye from the latitude 40°N.It appears to be a rich yellowish-white colour, although the yellow colour is more apparent during daylight observation with a telescope, due to the contrast against the blue sky.Capella is closer to the north celestial pole than any other first magnitude star.Its northern declination is such that it is actually invisible south of latitude 44°S—this includes southernmost New Zealand, Argentina and Chile as well as the Falkland Islands.Conversely it is circumpolar north of 44°N: for the whole of the United Kingdom, Canada and the northernmost United States, the star never sets.Capella and Vega are on opposite sides of the pole, at about the same distance from it, such that an imaginary line between the two stars will nearly pass through Polaris.Visible halfway between Orion's Belt and Polaris, Capella is at its highest in the night sky at midnight in early December and is regarded as a prominent star of the northern winter sky.A few degrees to the southwest of Capella lie three stars, Epsilon Aurigae, Zeta Aurigae, and Eta Aurigae, the latter two of which are known as "The Kids", or Haedi.The four form a familiar pattern, or asterism, in the sky.-- -- Distance  -- --
Based on an annual parallax shift of 76.20 milliarcseconds (with a margin of error of 0.46 milliarcseconds) as measured by the Hipparcos satellite, this system is estimated to be 42.8 light-years (13.12 parsecs) from Earth, with a margin of error of 0.3 light-years (0.09 parsecs).An alternative method to determine the distance is via the orbital parallax, which gives a distance of 42.92 light-years (13.159 parsecs) with a margin of error of only 0.1%.Capella is estimated to have been a little closer to the Solar System in the past, passing within 29 light-years distant around 237,000 years ago.At this range, it would have shone at apparent magnitude −0.82, comparable to Canopus today.In a 1960 paper, American astronomer Olin J. Eggen concluded that Capella was a member of the Hyades moving group, a group of stars moving in the same direction as the Hyades cluster, after analysing its proper motion and parallax.

Accompaniment is the musical part which provides the rhythmic and/or harmonic support for the melody or main themes of a song or instrumental piece.There are many different styles and types of accompaniment in different genres and styles of music.In homophonic music, the main accompaniment approach used in popular music, a clear vocal melody is supported by subordinate chords.In popular music and traditional music, the accompaniment parts typically provide the "beat" for the music and outline the chord progression of the song or instrumental piece.The accompaniment for a vocal melody or instrumental solo can be played by a single musician playing an instrument such as piano, pipe organ, or guitar.While any instrument can in theory be used as an accompaniment instrument, keyboard and guitar-family instruments tend to be used if there is only a single instrument, as these instruments can play chords and basslines simultaneously (chords and a bassline are easier to play simultaneously on keyboard instruments, but a fingerpicking guitarist can play chords and a bassline simultaneously on guitar).A solo singer can accompany herself by playing guitar or piano while she sings, and in some rare cases, a solo singer can even accompany himself or herself just using his or her voice and body (e.g., Bobby McFerrin).Alternatively, the accompaniment to a vocal melody or instrumental solo can be provided by a musical ensemble, ranging in size from a duo (e.g., cello and piano; guitar and double bass; synthesizer and percussion); a trio (e.g., a rock power trio of electric guitar, electric bass and drum kit; an organ trio); a quartet (e.g., a string quartet in Classical music can accompany a solo singer; a rock band or rhythm section in rock and pop; a jazz quartet in jazz); all the way to larger ensembles, such as concert bands, Big Bands (in jazz), pit orchestras in musical theatre; and orchestras, which, in addition to playing symphonies, can also provide accompaniment to a concerto solo instrumentalist or to solo singers in opera.With choral music, the accompaniment to a vocal solo can be provided by other singers in the choir, who sing harmony parts or countermelodies.Accompaniment parts range from so simple that a beginner can play them (e.g., simple three-note triad chords in a traditional folk song) to so complex that only an advanced player or singer can perform them (e.g., the piano parts in Schubert's Lieder art songs from the 19th century or vocal parts from a Renaissance music motet).-- -- Definition  -- --

An accompanist is a musician who plays an accompaniment part.Accompanists often play keyboard instruments (e.g., piano, pipe organ, synthesizer) or, in folk music and traditional styles, a guitar.While sight-reading (the ability to play a notated piece of music without preparing it) is important for many types of musicians, it is essential for professional accompanists.In auditions for musical theater and orchestras, an accompanist will often have to sight read music.A number of classical pianists have found success as accompanists rather than soloists; arguably the best known example is Gerald Moore, well known as a Lieder accompanist.In some American schools, the term collaborative piano is used, and hence, the title "collaborative pianist" (or collaborative artist) is replacing the title accompanist, because in many art songs and contemporary classical music songs, the piano part is complex and demands an advanced level of musicianship and technique.The term accompanist also refers to a musician (typically a pianist) who plays for singers, dancers, and other performers at an audition or rehearsal—but who does not necessarily participate in the ensemble that plays for the final performance (which might be an orchestra or a big band).-- -- -- Accompaniment figure  -- -- --
An accompaniment figure is a musical gesture used repeatedly in an accompaniment, such as:

Alberti bass and other arpeggio figures
Ostinati figures (repeated lines) or, in popular music, riffsNotated accompaniment may be indicated obbligato (obliged) or ad libitum (at one's pleasure).-- -- -- Dialogue accompaniment  -- -- --
Dialogue accompaniment is a form of call and response in which the lead and accompaniment alternate, the accompaniment playing during the rests of the lead and providing a drone or silence during the main melody or vocal.-- -- Notation and improvisation  -- --
The accompaniment instrumentalists and/or singers can be provided with a fully notated accompaniment part written or printed on sheet music.This is the norm in Classical music and in most large ensemble writing (e.g., orchestra, pit orchestra, choir).In popular music and traditional music, the accompaniment instrumentalists often improvise their accompaniment, either based on a lead sheet or chord chart which indicates the chords used in the song or piece (e.g., C Major, d minor, G7, or Nashville Numbers or Roman numerals, such as I, ii, V7, etc.)or by "playing by ear".Chord-playing musicians (e.g., those playing guitar, piano, Hammond organ, etc.)can improvise chords, "fill-in" melodic lines and solos from the chord chart.It is rare for chords to be fully written out in music notation in pop and traditional music.Some guitarists, bassists and other stringed instrumentalists read accompaniment parts using tabulature (or "tab"), a notation system which shows the musician where on the instrument to play the notes.

Members of the group are of a similar age, and those that are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun have moved off the main sequence after exhausting their core hydrogen reserves and are expanding and cooling into red giants.-- -- Stellar system  -- --

There are several stars within a few arc minutes of Capella and some have been listed as companions in various multiple star catalogues.The Washington Double Star Catalog lists components A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, O, P, Q, and R, with A being the naked-eye star.Most are only line-of-sight companions, but the close pair of red dwarfs H and L are at the same distance as the bright component A and moving through space along with it.Capella A is itself a spectroscopic binary with components Aa and Ab, both giant stars.The pair of giants is separated from the pair of red dwarfs by 723".American astronomer Robert Burnham Jr. described a scale model of the system where Capella A was represented by spheres 13 and 7 inches across, separated by ten feet.The red dwarfs were then each 0.7 inches across and they were separated by 420 feet.At this scale, the two pairs are 21 miles apart.-- -- -- Capella A  -- -- --

Capella A consists of two yellow evolved stars that have been calculated to orbit each other every 104.02128 ± 0.00016 days, with a semimajor axis of 111.11 ± 0.10 million km (0.74272 ± 0.00069 au), roughly the distance between Venus and the Sun.The pair is not an eclipsing binary—that is, as seen from Earth, neither star passes in front of the other.The orbit is known extremely accurately and can be used to derive an orbital parallax with far better precision than the one measured directly.The stars are not near enough to each other for the Roche lobe of either star to have been filled and any significant mass transfer to have taken place, even during the red giant stage of the primary star.Modern convention designates the more luminous cooler star as component Aa and its spectral type has been usually measured between G2 and K0.The hotter secondary Ab has been given various spectral types of late (cooler) F or early (warmer) G. The MK spectral types of the two stars have been measured a number of times, and they are both consistently assigned a luminosity class of III indicating a giant star.The composite spectrum appears to be dominated by the primary star due to its sharper absorption lines; the lines from the secondary are broadened and blurred by its rapid rotation.The composite spectral class is given as approximately G3III, but with a specific mention of features due to a cooler component.The most recent specific published types are K0III and G1III, although older values are still widely quoted such as G5IIIe + G0III from the Bright Star Catalogue or G8III + G0III by Eggen.Where the context is clear, these two components have been referred to as A and B.The individual apparent magnitudes of the two component stars cannot be directly measured, but their relative brightness has been measured at various wavelengths.They have very nearly equal brightness in the visible light spectrum, with the hotter secondary component generally being found to be a few tenths of a magnitude brighter.A 2016 measurement gives the magnitude difference between the two stars at a wavelength of 700 nm as 0.00 ± 0.1.The physical properties of the two stars can be determined with high accuracy.The masses are derived directly from the orbital solution, with Aa being 2.5687 ± 0.0074 M☉ and Ab being 2.4828 ± 0.0067 M☉.

David Grisman (born March 23, 1945) is an American mandolinist.His music combines bluegrass, folk, and jazz in a genre he calls "Dawg music".He founded the record label Acoustic Disc, which issues his recordings and those of other acoustic musicians.-- -- Biography  -- --
Grisman grew up in a Conservative Jewish household in Passaic, New Jersey.His father was professional trombonist who gave him piano lessons when he was seven years old.As teenager, he played piano, mandolin, and saxophone.In the early 1960s, he went to college at New York University.He belonged to the Even Dozen Jug Band with Maria Muldaur and John Sebastian.He played in the bluegrass band the Kentuckians led by Red Allen, then in the psychedelic rock band Earth Opera with Peter Rowan.He moved to San Francisco, met Jerry Garcia, and appeared on the Grateful Dead album American Beauty.He played in Garcia's bluegrass band Old & In the Way with Peter Rowan and Vassar Clements.Garcia named him "Dawg" after a dog that was following him while they were driving in Stinson Beach, California."Dawg Music" is what Grisman calls his mixture of bluegrass and Django Reinhardt/Stéphane Grappelli-influenced jazz as highlighted on his album Hot Dawg (recorded Oct. 1978, released 1979).It was Grisman's combination of Reinhardt-era jazz, bluegrass, folk, Old World Mediterranean string band music, as well as modern jazz fusion that came to embody "Dawg" music.In the 1970s, he started the David Grisman Quintet with Darol Anger, Joe Carroll, Todd Phillips, and Tony Rice.They released their first album in 1977 for Kaleidoscope Records and their second, Hot Dawg, two years later for Horizon Records, the jazz division of A&M Records.When the quintet recorded for Warner Bros. Records, the membership changed to include Mike Marshall, Mark O'Connor, and Rob Wasserman, with occasional guest appearances by jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli.In the 1980s, Grisman formed the record label Acoustic Disc, which issued his recordings and those by other acoustic musicians.Beginning in the 1990s, he released albums with a more jazz oriented sound when he recorded with bassist Jim Kerwin, drummer George Marsh, and guitarist Martin Taylor.But the folk and bluegrass part of his personality emerged when he recorded with Mark O'Connor, Tony Rice, and Andy Statman.On the albums Tone Poems and Tone Poems 2, he recorded traditional jazz and folk songs on vintage guitars, mandolins, and mandocellos that were built at the time the songs were composed.-- -- Family  -- --
Grisman is married to Tracy Bigelow and was married twice before.He has three grown children: Samson, Gillian, and Monroe.Samson, a bassist and recording session musician living in Portland, often performs with his father.Gillian, a filmmaker living in Novato, California, directed Grateful Dawg and the music documentary, Village Music: Last of the Great Record Stores.Monroe, named for bluegrass music pioneer Bill Monroe, lives in Fairfax, California, and plays in the Tom Petty tribute band Petty Theft.-- -- In media  -- --
Grisman's song "Dawggy Mountain Breakdown" was the opening theme song for Car Talk on NPR.Grisman sued YouTube in May 2007, asserting in federal court that YouTube should be required to prevent individuals from illegally uploading recordings of his music.Grisman's attorneys requested voluntary dismissal of the suit.The documentary Grateful Dawg (October 14, 2001) chronicles the friendship between Jerry Garcia and David Grisman.Grisman was a judge for the 6th and 7th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists.He wrote much of the bluegrass music for the 1974 film Big Bad Mama directed by Roger Corman.

Their angular radii have been directly measured; in combination with the very accurate distance, this gives 11.98 ± 0.57 R☉ and 8.83 ± 0.33 R☉ for Aa and Ab respectively.Their surface temperatures can be calculated by comparison of observed and synthetic spectra, direct measurement of their angular diameters and brightnesses, calibration against their observed colour indices, and disentangling of high resolution spectra.Weighted averages of these four methods give 4,970 ± 50 K for Aa and 5,730 ± 60 for Ab.Their bolometric luminosities are most accurately derived from their apparent magnitudes and bolometric corrections, but are confirmed by calculation from the temperatures and radii of the stars.Aa is 78.7 ± 4.2 times as luminous as the Sun and Ab 72.7 ± 3.6 times as luminous, so the star defined as the primary component is the more luminous when all wavelengths are considered but very slightly less bright at visual wavelengths.Estimated to be 590 to 650 million years old, the stars were probably at the hot end of spectral class A during their main sequence lifetime, similar to Vega.They have now exhausted their core hydrogen and evolved off the main sequence, their outer layers expanding and cooling.Despite the giant luminosity class, the secondary component is very clearly within the Hertzsprung gap on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, still expanding and cooling towards the red giant branch, making it a subgiant in evolutionary terms.The more massive primary has already passed through this stage, when it reached a maximum radius of 36 to 38 times that of the Sun.It is now a red clump star which is fusing helium to carbon and oxygen in its core, a process that has not yet begun for the less massive star.Detailed analysis shows that it is nearing the end of this stage and starting to expand again which will lead it to the asymptotic giant branch.Isotope abundances and spin rates confirm this evolutionary difference between the two stars.Heavy element abundances are broadly comparable to those of the Sun and the overall metallicity is slightly less than the Sun's.The rotational period of each star can be measured by observing periodic variations in the doppler shifts of their spectral lines.The absolute rotational velocities of the two stars are known from their inclinations, rotation periods, and sizes, but the projected equatorial rotational velocities measured using doppler broadening of spectral lines are a standard measure and these are generally quoted.Capella Aa has a projected rotational velocity of 4.1 ± 0.4 km per second, taking 104 ± 3 days to complete one rotation, while Capella Ab spins much more rapidly at 35.0±0.5 km per second, completing a full rotation in only 8.5 ± 0.2 days.Rotational braking occurs in all stars when they expand into giants, and binary stars are also tidally braked.Capella Aa has slowed until it is rotationally locked to the orbital period, although theory predicts that it should still be rotating more quickly from a starting point of a rapidly-spinning main sequence A star.Capella has long been suspected to be slightly variable.Its amplitude of about 0.1 magnitudes means that it may at times be brighter or fainter than Rigel, Betelgeuse, and Vega, which are also variable.The system has been classified as an RS Canum Venaticorum variable, a class of binary stars with active chromospheres that cause huge starspots, but it is still only listed as a suspected variable in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars.Unusually for RS CVn systems, the hotter star, Capella Ab, has the more active atmosphere because it is located in the Hertzsprung gap—a stage where it is changing its angular momentum and deepening its convection zone.The active atmospheres and closeness of these stars means that they are among the brightest X-ray sources in the sky.However the X-ray emission is due to stable coronal structures and not eruptive flaring activity.

  , which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field.This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909).However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields, and he published a paper on general relativity in 1916 with his theory of gravitation.He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules.He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.Except for one year in Prague, Einstein lived in Switzerland between 1895 and 1914, during which time he renounced his German citizenship in 1896, then received his academic diploma from the Swiss federal polytechnic school (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Zürich in 1900.After being stateless for more than five years, he acquired Swiss citizenship in 1901, which he kept for the rest of his life.In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich.The same year, he published four groundbreaking papers during his renowned annus mirabilis (miracle year) which brought him to the notice of the academic world at the age of 26.Einstein taught theoretical physics at Zurich between 1912 and 1914, before he left for Berlin, where he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences.In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power.Because of his Jewish background, Einstein did not return to Germany.He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential development of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type" and recommending that the US begin similar research.This eventually led to the Manhattan Project.Einstein supported the Allies, but he generally denounced the idea of using nuclear fission as a weapon.He signed the Russell–Einstein Manifesto with British philosopher Bertrand Russell, which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons.He was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955.Einstein published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works.His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".Eugene Wigner wrote of Einstein in comparison to his contemporaries that "Einstein's understanding was deeper even than Jancsi von Neumann's.His mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann's.And that is a very remarkable statement."

The seventh companion published for Capella, component H, is physically associated with the bright primary star.It is a red dwarf separated from the pair of G-type giants by a distance of around 10,000 AU.It has its own close companion, an even fainter red dwarf that was 1.8" away when it was discovered in 1935.Eighty years later the separation had increased to 3.5", sufficient to allow tentative orbital parameters to be derived.It is component L in double star catalogues.The Gliese-Jahreiss Catalogue of nearby stars designates the binary system as GJ 195.The two components are then referred to individually as GJ 195 A and B.The two stars are reported to have a 3.5 visual magnitude difference, 2.3 mag in the passband of the Gaia spacecraft, although the difference is much smaller at infrared wavelengths.This is unexpected and may indicate further unseen companions.The mass of the stars can be determined from the orbital motion, but uncertainties in the orbit have led to widely varying results.In 1975, an eccentric 388 year orbit gave masses of 0.65 M☉ and 0.13 M☉.A smaller near-circular orbit published in 2015 had a 300-year orbit, benefitting from mass constraints of 0.57 M☉ and 0.53 M☉ respectively for GJ 195 A and B based on their infrared magnitudes.-- -- -- Visual companions  -- -- --
Six visual companions to Capella were discovered before Capella H and are generally known only as Capella B through G. None are thought to be physically associated with Capella although all appear closer in the sky than the HL pair.Component F is also known as TYC 3358-3142-1.It is listed with a spectral type of K although it is included in a catalogue of OB stars as a distant luminous star.Component G is BD+45 1076, with a spectral type of F0, at a distance of 401 light-years (123 parsecs).It is identified as a variable member of the Guide Star Catalogue from Chandra observations although it is not known what type of variability.It is known to be an X-ray source with an active corona.Several other stars have also been catalogued as companions to Capella.Components I, Q, and R are 13th magnitude stars at distances of 92", 133", and 134".V538 Aurigae and its close companion HD 233153 are red dwarfs ten degrees away from Capella; they have very similar space motions but the small difference makes it possible that this is just a coincidence.Two faint stars have been discovered by speckle imaging in the Capella HL field, around 10" distant from that pair.

 -- -- -- Early life and education  -- -- --

Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879.His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch.In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.The Einsteins were non-observant Ashkenazi Jews, and Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the age of 5, for three years.At the age of 8, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the German Empire seven years later.In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient alternating current (AC) standard.The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory.In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia.When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium.His father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method.He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning.At the end of December 1894, he travelled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note.During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title "On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field".Einstein always excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers.The twelve-year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer.Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean theorem at age 12.A family tutor Max Talmud says that after he had given the 12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a short time "[Einstein] had worked through the whole book.He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics...Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow."His passion for geometry and algebra led the twelve-year-old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a "mathematical structure".Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a 14-year-old he says he had "mastered integral and differential calculus".At age 13, Einstein was introduced to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, and Kant became his favorite philosopher, his tutor stating: "At the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant's works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him."In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH).He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination, but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics.On the advice of the principal of the Polytechnic, he attended the Argovian cantonal school (gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling.While lodging with the family of professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie.Albert's sister Maja later married Winteler's son Paul.In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of Württemberg to avoid military service.In September 1896, he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1–6.At 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Zürich Polytechnic.Marie Winteler, who was a year older, moved to Olsberg, Switzerland, for a teaching post.Einstein's future wife, a 20-year-old Serbian woman Mileva Marić, also enrolled at the Polytechnic that year.

These have been catalogued as Capella O and P. It is not known whether they are physically associated with the red dwarf binary.-- -- Etymology and culture  -- --
Capella traditionally marks the left shoulder of the constellation's eponymous charioteer, or, according to the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy's Almagest, the goat that the charioteer is carrying.In Bayer's 1603 work Uranometria, Capella marks the charioteer's back.The three Haedi had been identified as a separate constellation by Pliny the Elder and Manilius, and were called Capra, Caper, or Hircus, all of which relate to its status as the "goat star".Ptolemy merged the Charioteer and the Goats in the 2nd century Almagest.In Greek mythology, the star represented the goat Amalthea that suckled Zeus.It was this goat whose horn, after accidentally being broken off by Zeus, was transformed into the Cornucopia, or "horn of plenty", which would be filled with whatever its owner desired.Though most often associated with Amalthea, Capella has sometimes been associated with Amalthea's owner, a nymph.The myth of the nymph says that the goat's hideous appearance, resembling a Gorgon, was partially responsible for the Titans' defeat, after Zeus skinned the goat and wore it as his aegis.In medieval accounts, it bore the uncommon name Alhajoth (also spelled Alhaior, Althaiot, Alhaiset, Alhatod, Alhojet, Alanac, Alanat, Alioc), which (especially the last) may be a corruption of its Arabic name, العيوق, al-cayyūq.cAyyūq has no clear significance in Arabic, but may be an Arabized form of the Greek αίξ aiks "goat"; cf.the modern Greek Αίγα Aiga, the feminine of goat.To the Bedouin of the Negev and Sinai, Capella al-'Ayyūq ath-Thurayyā "Capella of the Pleiades", from its role as pointing out the position of that asterism.Another name in Arabic was Al-Rākib "the driver", a translation of the Greek.To the ancient Balts, Capella was known as Perkūno Ožka "Thunder's Goat", or Tikutis.Conversely in Slavic Macedonian folklore, Capella was Jastreb "the hawk", flying high above and ready to pounce on Mother Hen (the Pleiades) and the Rooster (Nath).Astrologically, Capella portends civic and military honors and wealth.In the Middle Ages, it was considered a Behenian fixed star, with the stone sapphire and the plants horehound, mint, mugwort, and mandrake as attributes.Cornelius Agrippa listed its kabbalistic sign  with the name Hircus (Latin for goat).In Hindu mythology, Capella was seen as the heart of Brahma, Brahma Hṛdaya.In traditional Chinese astronomy, Capella was part of the asterism 五車 (Wŭ chē; English: Five Chariots), which consisted of Capella together with Beta Aurigae, Theta Aurigae, and Iota Aurigae, as well as Beta Tauri.Since it was the second star in this asterism, it has the Chinese name 五車二 (Wŭ chē èr; English: Second of the Five Chariots).In Quechua it was known as Colça; the Incas held the star in high regard.The Hawaiians saw Capella as part of an asterism Ke ka o Makali'i ("The canoe bailer of Makali'i") that helped them navigate at sea.Called Hoku-lei "star wreath", it formed this asterism with Procyon, Sirius, Castor and Pollux.In Tahitian folklore, Capella was Tahi-ari'i, the wife of Fa'a-nui (Auriga) and mother of prince Ta'urua (Venus) who sails his canoe across the sky.

She was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course.Over the next few years, Einstein's and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest.In 1900, Einstein passed the exams in Maths and Physics and was awarded the Federal Polytechnic teaching diploma.There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions.-- -- -- Marriages and children  -- -- --

An early correspondence between Einstein and Marić was discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the couple had a daughter named "Lieserl", born in early 1902 in Novi Sad where Marić was staying with her parents.Marić returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and fate are unknown.The contents of Einstein's letter in September 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.Einstein and Marić married in January 1903.In May 1904, their son Hans Albert Einstein was born in Bern, Switzerland.Their son Eduard was born in Zürich in July 1910.The couple moved to Berlin in April 1914, but Marić returned to Zürich with their sons after learning that Einstein's chief romantic attraction was his first and second cousin Elsa.They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years.Eduard had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia.His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, finally being committed permanently after her death.In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love Marie Winteler about his marriage and his strong feelings for her.He wrote in 1910, while his wife was pregnant with their second child: "I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be."He spoke about a "misguided love" and a "missed life" regarding his love for Marie.Einstein married Elsa Löwenthal in 1919, after having a relationship with her since 1912.She was a first cousin maternally and a second cousin paternally.They emigrated to the United States in 1933.Elsa was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems in 1935 and died in December 1936.-- -- -- Friends  -- -- --
Among Einstein's well-known friends were Michele Besso, Paul Ehrenfest, Marcel Grossmann, János Plesch, Daniel Q. Posin, Maurice Solovine, and Stephen Wise.-- -- -- Patent office  -- -- --

After graduating in 1900, Einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post.He acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901, but for medical reasons was not conscripted.With the help of Marcel Grossmann's father, he secured a job in Bern at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property, the patent office, as an assistant examiner – level III.Einstein evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter.In 1903, his position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he "fully mastered machine technology".Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical–mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time.With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group in 1902, self-mockingly named "The Olympia Academy", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy.Their readings included the works of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, and David Hume, which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.-- -- -- -- First scientific papers  -- -- -- --

In 1900, Einstein's paper "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen" ("Conclusions from the Capillarity Phenomena") was published in the journal Annalen der Physik.On 30 April 1905, Einstein completed his thesis, with Alfred Kleiner, Professor of Experimental Physics, serving as pro-forma advisor.

In Inuit astronomy, Capella, along with Menkalinan (Beta Aurigae), Pollux (Beta Geminorum) and Castor (Alpha Geminorum), formed a constellation Quturjuuk, "collar-bones", the two pairs of stars denoting a bone each.Used for navigation and time-keeping at night, the constellation was recognised from Alaska to western Greenland.The Gwich'in saw Capella and Menkalinan has forming shreets'ą įį vidzee, the right ear of the large circumpolar constellation Yahdii, which covered much of the night sky, and whose orientation facilitated navigation and timekeeping.In Australian Aboriginal mythology for the Boorong people of Victoria, Capella was Purra, the kangaroo, pursued and killed by the nearby Gemini twins, Yurree (Castor) and Wanjel (Pollux).The Wardaman people of northern Australia knew the star as Yagalal, a ceremonial fish scale, related to Guwamba the barramundi (Aldebaran).-- -- Namesakes  -- --

As a result, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich, with his dissertation A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions.In that same year, which has been called Einstein's annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.-- -- -- Academic career  -- -- --
By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern.The following year, after giving a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the University of Zürich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics.Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so.During his Prague stay, he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids.In July 1912, he returned to his alma mater in Zürich.From 1912 until 1914, he was professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics.He also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Grossmann.On 3 July 1913, he was voted for membership in the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin.Max Planck and Walther Nernst visited him the next week in Zurich to persuade him to join the academy, additionally offering him the post of director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, which was soon to be established.(Membership in the academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching duties at the Humboldt University of Berlin.)He was officially elected to the academy on 24 July, and he accepted to move to the German Empire the next year.His decision to move to Berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin Elsa, with whom he had developed a romantic affair.He joined the academy and thus the Berlin University on 1 April 1914.As World War I broke out that year, the plan for Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics was aborted.The institute was established on 1 October 1917, with Einstein as its director.In 1916, Einstein was elected president of the German Physical Society (1916–1918).Based on calculations Einstein made in 1911, about his new theory of general relativity, light from another star should be bent by the Sun's gravity.In 1919, that prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919.Those observations were published in the international media, making Einstein world-famous.On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper The Times printed a banner headline that read: "Revolution in Science – New Theory of the Universe – Newtonian Ideas Overthrown".In 1920, he became a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.In 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".While the general theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial, the citation also does not treat even the cited photoelectric work as an explanation but merely as a discovery of the law, as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the Planck spectrum by S. N. Bose.Einstein was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1921.He also received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1925.-- -- -- 1921–1922: Travels abroad  -- -- --
Einstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921, where he received an official welcome by Mayor John Francis Hylan, followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions.He went on to deliver several lectures at Columbia University and Princeton University, and in Washington he accompanied representatives of the National Academy of Science on a visit to the White House.On his return to Europe he was the guest of the British statesman and philosopher Viscount Haldane in London, where he met several renowned scientific, intellectual and political figures, and delivered a lecture at King's College London.

The 18th century lasted from January 1, 1701 to December 31, 1800.During the 18th century, elements of Enlightenment thinking culminated in the American, French, and Haitian revolutions.This was an age of violent slave trading, and global human trafficking.The reactions against monarchical and aristocratic power helped fuel the revolutionary responses against it throughout the century.The period is also known as the "century of lights" or the "century of reason".In continental Europe, philosophers dreamed of a brighter age.For some, this dream turned into a reality with the French Revolution of 1789, though later compromised by the excesses of the Reign of Terror (1793–1794) under Maximilien Robespierre.At first, many monarchies of Europe embraced Enlightenment ideals, but with the French Revolution they feared losing their power and formed broad coalitions for the counter-revolution.The Ottoman Empire experienced an unprecedented period of peace and economic expansion, taking part in no European wars from 1740 to 1768.As a consequence the empire did not share in Europe's military improvements during the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), causing its military to fall behind and suffer defeats against Russia in the second half of the century.18th century music included the Late Baroque period (including Johan Sebastian Bach and George Frederic Handel) and the classical period (including Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart).The 18th century also marked the end of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as an independent state.The once-powerful and vast kingdom, which had once conquered Moscow and defeated great Ottoman armies, collapsed under numerous invasions.Its semi-democratic government system was not robust enough to rival the neighboring monarchies of the Kingdom of Prussia, the Russian Empire and the Austrian Empire which divided the Commonwealth territories between themselves, changing the landscape of Central European politics for the next hundred years.European colonization of the Americas and other parts of the world intensified and associated mass migrations of people grew in size as the Age of Sail continued.Great Britain became a major power worldwide with the French and Indian War in the 1760s and the conquest of large parts of India, especially Bengal.However, Britain lost many of its North American colonies after the American Revolution and Indian wars.In Central Asia, Nader Shah caused major invasions and led successful military campaigns and the Durrani Empire was founded.In the Indian subcontinent, the death of the Islamic Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb marks the end of the medieval India and the beginning of the modern India and the beginning of European invasion India.The victory of the British East India Company over the Nawab of Bengal and their French allies in the Battle of Plassey caused the deindustrialization of Bengal and the beginning of the British Industrial Revolution which radically changed human society and the environment.

He also published an essay, "My First Impression of the U.S.A.", in July 1921, in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of Americans, much as had Alexis de Tocqueville, who published his own impressions in Democracy in America (1835).For some of his observations, Einstein was clearly surprised: "What strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life ...The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and without envy."In 1922, his travels took him to Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour, as he visited Singapore, Ceylon and Japan, where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese.After his first public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at the Imperial Palace, where thousands came to watch.In a letter to his sons, he described his impression of the Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for art.In his own travel diaries from his 1922–23 visit to Asia, he expresses some views on the Chinese, Japanese and Indian people, which have been described as xenophobic and racist judgments when they were rediscovered in 2018.Because of Einstein's travels to the Far East, he was unable to personally accept the Nobel Prize for Physics at the Stockholm award ceremony in December 1922.In his place, the banquet speech was held by a German diplomat, who praised Einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist.On his return voyage, he visited Palestine for 12 days in what would become his only visit to that region.He was greeted as if he were a head of state, rather than a physicist, which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the British high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel.During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him.In Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.Einstein visited Spain for two weeks in 1923, where he briefly met Santiago Ramón y Cajal and also received a diploma from King Alfonso XIII naming him a member of the Spanish Academy of Sciences.From 1922 to 1932, Einstein was a member of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations in Geneva (with a few months of interruption in 1923–1924), a body created to promote international exchange between scientists, researchers, teachers, artists and intellectuals.Originally slated to serve as the Swiss delegate, Secretary-General Eric Drummond was persuaded by Catholic activists Oskar Halecki and Giuseppe Motta to instead have him become the German delegate, thus allowing Gonzague de Reynold to take the Swiss spot, from which he promoted traditionalist Catholic values.Einstein’s former physics professor Hendrik Lorentz and the French chemist Marie Curie were also members of the committee.-- -- -- 1930–1931: Travel to the US  -- -- --
In December 1930, Einstein visited America for the second time, originally intended as a two-month working visit as a research fellow at the California Institute of Technology.After the national attention he received during his first trip to the US, he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy.Although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, he declined them all.After arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various places and events, including Chinatown, a lunch with the editors of The New York Times, and a performance of Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera, where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival.During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as "the ruling monarch of the mind".Harry Emerson Fosdick, pastor at New York's Riverside Church, gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance.Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration.Einstein next traveled to California, where he met Caltech president and Nobel laureate, Robert A. Millikan.His friendship with Millikan was "awkward", as Millikan "had a penchant for patriotic militarism", where Einstein was a pronounced pacifist.During an address to Caltech's students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good.This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for their pacifism.Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios, gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin.They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner.Chaplin said Einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a "highly emotional temperament", from which came his "extraordinary intellectual energy".Chaplin's film, City Lights, was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests.Walter Isaacson, Einstein's biographer, described this as "one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity".Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin, and recalled his "modest little flat" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory.

The British invasion since then expanded to cover much of South Asia.French-Italian emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, formed one of the Franco-Indian alliances with the major economic power Kingdom of Mysore, governed by Tipu Sultan and his father Hyder Ali, who pioneered the use of Rocket artillery and the world's first iron-cased rockets, the Mysorean rockets, through the compilation of the Fathul Mujahidin.The Anglo-Mysore Wars were fought  and the Treaty of Mangalore was initiated in 1784.The defeat of the British resulted in the formation of the newly independent United States.Western historians have occasionally defined the 18th century otherwise for the purposes of their work.For example, the "short" 18th century may be defined as 1715–1789, denoting the period of time between the death of Louis XIV of France and the start of the French Revolution, with an emphasis on directly interconnected events.To historians who expand the century to include larger historical movements, the "long" 18th century may run from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 or even later.-- -- Events  -- --

In February 1933, while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler.While at American universities in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.He and his wife Elsa returned to Europe by ship in March, and during the trip they learned that the German Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which transformed Hitler's government into a de facto legal dictatorship and that they would not be able to proceed to Berlin.Later on they heard that their cottage was raided by the Nazis and his personal sailboat confiscated.Upon landing in Antwerp, Belgium on 28 March, he immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship.The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a Hitler Youth camp.After staying some days at Castle Cantecroy in Mortsel, a villa was rented in De Haan on the Belgian coast for half a year.On 9 September, they took the ferry to Dover, and arrived in the US on 17 October.-- -- -- -- Refugee status  -- -- -- --

In April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities.Historian Gerald Holton describes how, with "virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues", thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.A month later, Einstein's works were among those targeted by the German Student Union in the Nazi book burnings, with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels proclaiming, "Jewish intellectualism is dead."One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, "not yet hanged", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head.In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend Max Born, who had already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, "...I must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise."After moving to the US, he described the book burnings as a "spontaneous emotional outburst" by those who "shun popular enlightenment", and "more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence".Einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany.He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months.In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years.To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside London, with a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein, published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.Locker-Lampson took Einstein to meet Winston Churchill at his home, and later, Austen Chamberlain and former Prime Minister Lloyd George.Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany.British historian Martin Gilbert notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend, physicist Frederick Lindemann, to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in British universities.Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out, they had lowered their "technical standards" and put the Allies' technology ahead of theirs.Einstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including Turkey's Prime Minister, İsmet İnönü, to whom he wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists.As a result of Einstein's letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over "1,000 saved individuals".Locker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe.In one of his speeches he denounced Germany's treatment of Jews, while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere.In his speech he described Einstein as a "citizen of the world" who should be offered a temporary shelter in the UK.Both bills failed, however, and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey, US, to become a resident scholar.-- -- -- -- Resident scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study  -- -- -- --

In October 1933, Einstein returned to the US and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study, noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany.At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their Jewish quotas, which lasted until the late 1940s.Einstein was still undecided on his future.He had offers from several European universities, including Christ Church, Oxford where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered a 5-year studentship, but in 1935, he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship.Einstein's affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955.

He was one of the four first selected (two of the others being John von Neumann and Kurt Gödel) at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with Gödel.The two would take long walks together discussing their work.Bruria Kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist.During this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully.-- -- -- -- World War II and the Manhattan Project  -- -- -- --

In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist Leó Szilárd attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research.The group's warnings were discounted.Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, "regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon."To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered.He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilárd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.The letter is believed to be "arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II".In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office.Some say that as a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the US entered the "race" to develop the bomb, drawing on its "immense material, financial, and scientific resources" to initiate the Manhattan Project.For Einstein, "war was a disease ... [and] he called for resistance to war."By signing the letter to Roosevelt, some argue he went against his pacifist principles.In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, "I made one great mistake in my life—when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification—the danger that the Germans would make them ..."

Einstein became an American citizen in 1940.Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study (in Princeton, New Jersey), he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in American culture when compared to Europe.He recognized the "right of individuals to say and think what they pleased", without social barriers, and as a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his own early education.Einstein joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned for the civil rights of African Americans.He considered racism America's "worst disease", seeing it as "handed down from one generation to the next".As part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist W. E. B.Du Bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951.When Einstein offered to be a character witness for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case.In 1946 Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree.(Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college degrees to African Americans; alumni include Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall.)Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, adding, "I do not intend to be quiet about it."A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student.-- -- -- Personal life  -- -- --

Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land.That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an "evil" that was undermining a third of the country's development.Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important.Chaim Weizmann later became Israel's first president.Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the position of President of Israel, a mostly ceremonial post.The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer "embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons".Einstein declined, and wrote in his response that he was "deeply moved", and "at once saddened and ashamed" that he could not accept it.-- -- -- -- Love of music  -- -- -- --

Einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age.In his late journals he wrote: "If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician.I often think in music.I live my daydreams in music.I see my life in terms of music...I get most joy in life out of music."His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into German culture.According to conductor Leon Botstein, Einstein began playing when he was 5.However, he did not enjoy it at that age.When he turned 13, he discovered the violin sonatas of Mozart, whereupon he became enamored of Mozart's compositions and studied music more willingly.Einstein taught himself to play without "ever practicing systematically".He said that "love is a better teacher than a sense of duty."At age 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau while playing Beethoven's violin sonatas.The examiner stated afterward that his playing was "remarkable and revealing of 'great insight'".What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein "displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply.Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student."Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein's life from that period on.Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends.Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others.He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Köchel catalogue of Mozart's work; that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein, who may have been a distant relation.In 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of Beethoven and Mozart's works with members of the Zoellner Quartet.Near the end of his life, when the young Juilliard Quartet visited him in Princeton, he played his violin with them, and the quartet was "impressed by Einstein's level of coordination and intonation".-- -- -- -- Political and religious views  -- -- -- --

Einstein's political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as "Why Socialism?".

Einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics.He strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation.The FBI created a secret dossier on Einstein in 1932, and by the time of his death his FBI file was 1,427 pages long.Einstein was deeply impressed by Mahatma Gandhi.He exchanged written letters with Gandhi, and called him "a role model for the generations to come" in a letter writing about him.Einstein spoke of his spiritual outlook in a wide array of original writings and interviews.Einstein stated that he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic God of Baruch Spinoza's philosophy.He did not believe in a personal God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naïve.He clarified, however, that "I am not an atheist", preferring to call himself an agnostic, or a "deeply religious nonbeliever".When asked if he believed in an afterlife, Einstein replied, "No.And one life is enough for me."Einstein was primarily affiliated with non-religious humanist and Ethical Culture groups in both the UK and US.He served on the advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York, and was an honorary associate of the Rationalist Association, which publishes New Humanist in Britain.For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism.He observed, "Without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity."In a one-and-a-half-page hand-written German-language letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind, dated Princeton, 3 January 1954, fifteen months before his death, Einstein wrote: "The word God is for me nothing but the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of venerable but still rather primitive legends.No interpretation, no matter how subtle, can (for me) change anything about this.[...] For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstition.[...] I cannot see anything 'chosen' about them [the Jewish people]."-- -- -- Death  -- -- --
On 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948.He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the State of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live long enough to complete it.Einstein refused surgery, saying, "I want to go when I want.It is tasteless to prolong life artificially.I have done my share; it is time to go.I will do it elegantly."He died in Princeton Hospital early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end.During the autopsy, the pathologist of Princeton Hospital, Thomas Stoltz Harvey, removed Einstein's brain for preservation without the permission of his family, in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent.Einstein's remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.In a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965, at UNESCO headquarters, nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer summarized his impression of Einstein as a person: "He was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness ...There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn."-- -- Scientific career  -- --

On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the release of Einstein's papers, comprising more than 30,000 unique documents.Einstein's intellectual achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".In addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the Bose–Einstein statistics, the Einstein refrigerator and others.-- -- -- 1905 – Annus Mirabilis papers  -- -- --

The Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to quantum theory), Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E  -- mc2 that Einstein published in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal in 1905.These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, and matter.The four papers are:


 -- -- -- Statistical mechanics  -- -- --


 -- -- -- -- Thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics  -- -- -- --

Einstein's first paper submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction.It was published in 1901 with the title "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen", which translates as "Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena".Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view.These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist.His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.-- -- -- -- Theory of critical opalescence  -- -- -- --

Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point.Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density.At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations.The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white.Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.-- -- -- Special relativity  -- -- --

Einstein's "Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper" ("On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year.It reconciled conflicts between Maxwell's equations (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics.Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light).The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity.This paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down, and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion.This paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.In his paper on mass–energy equivalence, Einstein produced E  -- mc2 as a consequence of his special relativity equations.Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with Max Planck.Einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies).In 1908, Hermann Minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime.Einstein adopted Minkowski's formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity.-- -- -- General relativity  -- -- --

General relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915.According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses.

General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics.It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.As Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity.In that article titled "On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It", he argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply.This argument is called the equivalence principle.In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation, gravitational redshift and deflection of light.In 1911, Einstein published another article "On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies.Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.-- -- -- -- Gravitational waves  -- -- -- --
In 1916, Einstein predicted gravitational waves, ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation.The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it.By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.The first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16.The explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves.Einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves, detected on Earth on 14 September 2015, exactly one hundred years after the prediction.-- -- -- -- Hole argument and Entwurf theory  -- -- -- --

While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory.He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible.He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations, and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.In June 1913, the Entwurf ('draft') theory was the result of these investigations.As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions.After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915.-- -- -- -- Physical cosmology  -- -- -- --

In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole.He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding.As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe.The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years.This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.Following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by Edwin Hubble in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, The Friedmann-Einstein universe of 1931 and the Einstein–de Sitter universe of 1932.In each of these models, Einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was "in any case theoretically unsatisfactory".In many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his "biggest blunder".The astrophysicist Mario Livio has recently cast doubt on this claim, suggesting that it may be exaggerated.In late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist Cormac O'Raifeartaigh discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble's observations of the recession of the nebulae, Einstein considered a steady-state model of the universe.

The terms A-side and B-side refer to the two sides of 78, 45, and 33​1⁄3 rpm phonograph records, or cassettes, whether singles, extended plays (EPs), or long-playing (LP) records.The A-side usually featured the recording that the artist, record producer, or the record company intended to receive the initial promotional effort and then receive radio airplay, hopefully, to become a "hit" record.The B-side (or "flip-side") is a secondary recording that has a history of its own: some artists released B-sides that were considered as strong as the A-side and became hits in their own right.Others took the opposite approach: producer Phil Spector was in the habit of filling B-sides with on-the-spot instrumentals that no one would confuse with the A-side.With this practice, Spector was assured that airplay was focused on the side he wanted to be the hit side.Music recordings have moved away from records onto other formats such as CDs and digital downloads, which do not have "sides", but the terms are still used to describe the type of content, with B-side sometimes standing for "bonus" track.-- -- History  -- --
The first sound recordings at the end of the 19th century were made on cylinder records, which had a single round surface capable of holding approximately two minutes of sound.Early shellac disc records records only had recordings on one side of the disc, with a similar capacity (both media could hold between three and four minutes by 1910).Double-sided recordings, with one selection on each side, were introduced in Europe by Columbia Records in 1908, and by 1910 most record labels had adopted the format in both Europe and the United States; the ability to effectively double the amount of sound on the disc was one major factor in its rising to dominance over the cylinder record which was obsolete by 1912.There were no record charts until the 1930s, and radio stations (by and large) did not play recorded music until the 1950s (when top 40 radio overtook full-service network radio).In this time, A-sides and B-sides existed, but neither side was considered more important; the "side" did not convey anything about the content of the record.In June 1948, Columbia Records introduced the modern 33​1⁄3 rpm long-playing (LP) microgroove vinyl record for commercial sales, and its rival RCA Victor, responded the next year with the seven-inch 45 rpm vinylite record, which would quickly replace the 78 for single record releases.The term "single" came into popular use with the advent of vinyl records in the early 1950s.At first, most record labels would randomly assign which song would be an A-side and which would be a B-side.(All records have specific identifiers for each side in addition to the catalog number for the record itself; the "A" side would typically be assigned a sequentially lower number.)Under this random system, many artists had so-called "double-sided hits", where both songs on a record made one of the national sales charts (in Billboard, Cashbox, or other magazines), or would be featured on jukeboxes in public places.As time wore on, however, the convention for assigning songs to sides of the record changed.By the early sixties, the song on the A-side was the song that the record company wanted radio stations to play, as 45 rpm single records (or '45s') dominated the market in terms of cash sales.It was not until 1968, for example, that the total production of albums on a unit basis finally surpassed that of singles in the United Kingdom.In the late 1960s, stereo versions of pop and rock songs began to regularly appear on 45s.The majority of the 45s were played on AM radio stations, which were not equipped for stereo broadcast at the time, so stereo was not a priority.However, the FM rock stations did not like to play monaural content, so the record companies adopted a protocol for DJ versions with the mono version of the song on one side, and stereo version of the same song on the other.By the early 1970s, double-sided hits had become rare.Album sales had increased, and B-sides had become the side of the record where non-album, non-radio-friendly, instrumental versions or simply inferior recordings were placed.In order to further ensure that radio stations played the side that the record companies had chosen, it was common for the promotional copies (DJ version) of a single to have the "plug side" on both sides of the disc.With the decline of 45 rpm vinyl records, after the introduction of cassette and compact disc singles in the late 1980s, the A-side/B-side differentiation became much less meaningful.At first, cassette singles would often have one song on each side of the cassette, matching the arrangement of vinyl records, but eventually, cassette maxi-singles, containing more than two songs, became more popular.Cassette singles were phased out beginning in the late 1990s, and the A-side/B-side dichotomy became virtually extinct, as the remaining dominant medium, the compact disc, lacked an equivalent physical distinction.However, the term "B-side" is still used to refer to the "bonus" tracks or "coupling" tracks on a CD single.

In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process he associated with the cosmological constant.As he stated in the paper, "In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel's [sic] facts, and in which the density is constant over time" ... "If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it.For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space."It thus appears that Einstein considered a steady-state model of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold.However, Einstein's steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.-- -- -- -- Energy momentum pseudotensor  -- -- -- --

General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum.Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry.The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.Einstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates.He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field.This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin Schrödinger and others.-- -- -- -- Wormholes  -- -- -- --

In 1935, Einstein collaborated with Nathan Rosen to produce a model of a wormhole, often called Einstein–Rosen bridges.His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper "Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?".These solutions cut and pasted Schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches.If one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged.These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.-- -- -- -- Einstein–Cartan theory  -- -- -- --

In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion.This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.-- -- -- -- Equations of motion  -- -- -- --

The theory of general relativity has a fundamental law—the Einstein field equations, which describe how space curves.The geodesic equation, which describes how particles move, may be derived from the Einstein field equations.Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law.So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.This was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by Roy Kerr for spinning objects.-- -- -- Old quantum theory  -- -- --


 -- -- -- -- Photons and energy quanta  -- -- -- --

In a 1905 paper, Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta).Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr.This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering.Einstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck's constant.

With the advent of downloading music via the Internet, sales of CD singles and other physical media have declined, and the term "B-side" is now less commonly used.Songs that were not part of an artist's collection of albums are made available through the same downloadable catalogs as tracks from their albums, and are usually referred to as "unreleased", "bonus", "non-album", "rare", "outtakes" or "exclusive" tracks, the latter in the case of a song being available solely from a certain provider of music.-- -- Significance  -- --
B-side songs may be released on the same record as a single to provide extra "value for money".There are several types of material commonly released in this way, including a different version (e.g., instrumental, a cappella, live, acoustic, remixed version or in another language), or, in a concept record, a song that does not fit into the story line.Additionally, it was common in the 1960s and 1970s for longer songs, especially by soul, funk, and R&B acts, to be broken into two parts for single release.Examples of this include Ray Charles's "What'd I Say", the Isley Brothers' "Shout", and a number of records by James Brown, including "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag" and "Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud".Typically, "part one" would be the chart hit, while "part two" would be a continuation of the same performance.A notable example of a non-R&B hit with two parts was the single release of Don McLean's "American Pie".With the advent of the 12in single in the late 1970s, the part one/part two method of recording was largely abandoned.Modern day examples are Fall Out Boy's EP, My Heart Will Always Be The B-Side To My Tongue, or My Chemical Romance's The Black Parade, The B-Sides
Since both sides of a single received equal royalties, some composers deliberately arranged for their songs to be used as the B-sides of singles by popular artists.This became known as the "flipside racket".Similarly, it has also been alleged that owners of pirate radio stations operating off the British coast in the 1960s would buy the publishing rights to the B-sides of records they expected to be hits, and then plug the A-sides in the hope of driving up sales and increasing their share of the royalties.Occasionally, the B-side of a single would become the more popular song.This sometimes occurred because a DJ preferred the B-side to its A-side and played it instead.Some examples include "I Will Survive" by Gloria Gaynor (originally the B-side of "Substitute"), 
"Ice Ice Baby" by Vanilla Ice (originally the B-side of "Play That Funky Music"), "I'll Be Around" by the Spinners (originally the B-side of "How Could I Let You Get Away") and "Maggie May" by Rod Stewart (originally the B-side of "Reason to Believe").Probably the most well-known of these, however, is "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley & His Comets (originally the B-side of "Thirteen Women (And Only One Man In Town))".The song "How Soon Is Now?"by the Smiths started out as the extra track on the 12-inch of William, It Was Really Nothing but later gained a separate release as an A-side in its own right, as did Oasis's "Acquiesce", which originally appeared as a B-side to "Some Might Say" in 1995, but gained subsequent release in 2006 as part of an EP to promote their forthcoming compilation album, Stop the Clocks.Feeder in 2001 and 2005 had the B-sides "Just a Day" from "Seven Days in the Sun", and "Shatter" from "Tumble and Fall" released as A-sides after fan petitions and official website and fansite message board hype, and both charted at No.12 and No.11 in the UK.In 1986, the first single from XTC's record Skylarking, "Grass", was eclipsed in the United States by its B-side, "Dear God" – so much so that the record was almost immediately re-released with one song ("Mermaid Smiled") removed and "Dear God" put in its place, becoming one of the band's better-known hits.On many reissued singles, the A- and B-sides are two hit songs from different albums that were not originally released together, or were by completely different artists, altogether.These were often made for the jukebox, as one record with two popular songs on it would make more money, or to promote an artist to the fans of another.For example, in 1981 Kraftwerk released their new single "Computer Love" coupled with the B-side "The Model", from their 1978 LP The Man-Machine.With synthpop increasingly dominating the UK charts, the single was re-released with the sides reversed.In early 1982 "The Model" reached number one.-- -- Double A-side  -- --
A "double A-side" is a single where both sides are designated the A-side; there is no B-side on such a single.In 1949, Savoy Records promoted a new single by one of its artists, Paul Williams' "House Rocker" and "He Knows How to Hucklebuck", as "The New Double Side Hit – Both Sides "A" Sides".In 1965, Billboard reported that due to a disagreement between EMI and John Lennon about which side of the Beatles' "We Can Work It Out" and "Day Tripper" single should be considered the A-side and receive the plugging, "EMI settled for a double-side promotion campaign—unique in Britain."They continued to use the format for the release of the singles "Eleanor Rigby" and "Yellow Submarine" in 1966, followed by "Strawberry Fields Forever" / "Penny Lane" in 1967, and "Something" / "Come Together" in 1969.

He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave.But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.-- -- -- -- Quantized atomic vibrations  -- -- -- --

In 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator.In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator.Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics.Peter Debye refined this model.-- -- -- -- Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables  -- -- -- --

Throughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems.After Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the periodic table of the elements.Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made.Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process.Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant.Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.-- -- -- -- Bose–Einstein statistics  -- -- -- --

In 1924, Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles.Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik.Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder.Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons.Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.-- -- -- -- Wave–particle duality  -- -- -- --

Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia.In 1908, he became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern.In "Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung" ("The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation"), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles.This paper introduced the photon concept (although the name photon was introduced later by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1926) and inspired the notion of wave–particle duality in quantum mechanics.Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.-- -- -- -- Zero-point energy  -- -- -- --

In a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his "second quantum theory".Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern.Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data.The numbers matched nicely.

Other groups followed suit, notably the Rolling Stones in early 1967 with "Let's Spend the Night Together" / "Ruby Tuesday" as a double-A single.A double A-sided single is often confused with a single where both sides, the A and the B, became hits.Although many artists in the late 1950s and early 1960s like Elvis Presley, the Everly Brothers, Fats Domino, Ricky Nelson, the Beach Boys, Brenda Lee, and Pat Boone, routinely had hit singles where both sides of the 45 received airplay, these were not double A-sides.The charts below tally the instances for artists' singles where both sides were hits, not where both sides were designated an A-side upon manufacture and release.For instance "Don't Be Cruel", the B-side of "Hound Dog" by Elvis Presley, became as big a hit as its A-side even though "Don't Be Cruel" was not the intended A-side when released in 1956.Reissues later in the 1960s (and after the Beatles' "Day Tripper"/"We Can Work It Out") listed the single with both songs as the A-side.Also, for Cliff Richard's 1962 "The Next Time"/"Bachelor Boy", both sides were marketed as songs with chart potential, albeit with "Bachelor Boy" pressed as the B-side.In the UK, before the advent of digital downloads, both A-sides were accredited with the same chart position, as the singles' chart was compiled entirely from physical sales.In the UK, the biggest-selling non-charity single of all time was a double A-side, Wings' 1977 release "Mull of Kintyre"/"Girls' School", which sold over two million copies.It was also the UK Christmas No.1 that year, one of only two occasions on which a double A-side has topped that chart, the other being Queen's 1991 re-release of "Bohemian Rhapsody" with "These Are the Days of Our Lives".Nirvana released "All Apologies" and "Rape Me" as a double A-side in 1993, and both songs are accredited as a hit on both the UK Singles Chart, and the Irish Singles Chart.Queen released their first double-A single, "Killer Queen"/"Flick of the Wrist", in 1974."Killer Queen" became a hit, while "Flick of the Wrist" was all but ignored for lack of promotion.Three years later, they released "We Are the Champions" with "We Will Rock You" as a B-side.Both sides of the single received much radio airplay (often one after the other), which led to them sometimes being referred to as a double A-side.In 1978 they released "Fat Bottomed Girls"/"Bicycle Race" as a double A-side; that time both sides of the single became hits.Occasionally double-A-sided singles were released with each side targeting a different market.During the late 1970s, for example, Dolly Parton released a number of double-A-sided singles, in which one side was released to pop radio, and the other side to country, including "Two Doors Down"/"It's All Wrong, But It's All Right" and "Baby I'm Burning"/"I Really Got the Feeling".In 1978, the Bee Gees also used this method when they released "Too Much Heaven" for the pop market and the flip side, "Rest Your Love on Me", which was aimed toward country stations.Many artists continue to release double A-sided singles outside of the US where it is seen as more popular.Examples of this include Oasis's "Little by Little"/"She Is Love" (2002), Bloc Party's "So Here We Are"/"Positive Tension" (2005) and Gorillaz's "El Mañana"/"Kids with Guns" (2006).Artists having the most US double-sided singles on which each side charted in the US Hot 100, according to Billboard:
Perry Como (12) and Nat King Cole (19) both had additional double-sided singles on Billboard's pre-1955 charts.Artists having the most US double-sided singles on which each side reached the Billboard Top 40, according to Billboard:


 -- -- Double B-side  -- --
On vinyl, double A-sided singles had one song on either side of the record, while double B-sides contained two songs on the same side (on the B-side, making three songs in all).When such singles were introduced in the 1970s, the popular term for them was "maxi single", though this term is now used more ambiguously for a variety of formats.For some people these records would not quite qualify as EPs, for those generally have four songs on a 45.Genesis's 1978 7-inch single "Many Too Many" featured two B-sides, "The Day the Light Went Out" and "Vancouver", both of them being outtakes from the ...And Then There Were Three... album.There was no 12-inch equivalent.The band released two 7-inch singles with three tracks apiece, Spot the Pigeon and 3X3 (also known as "Paperlate"), which were explicitly marked as EPs."Spot the Pigeon" was also available in a 12-inch version, and also subverted this format a bit, by having two tracks on the A-side and one track on the B-side.The B-side, "Inside and Out", was also considered the selling point of the EP, being Steve Hackett's last contribution to the band, and remains a favorite of many fans.Paul McCartney's 1980 single "Coming Up" had a studio version of the song on the A-side, while the B-side contained two songs, a live version of "Coming Up" and a studio instrumental called "Lunchbox/Odd Sox".

However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy.-- -- -- -- Stimulated emission  -- -- -- --

In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser.This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode.This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.-- -- -- -- Matter waves  -- -- -- --

Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first.In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton–Jacobi equation of mechanics.This paper would inspire Schrödinger's work of 1926.-- -- -- Quantum mechanics  -- -- --


 -- -- -- -- Einstein's objections to quantum mechanics  -- -- -- --

Einstein was displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925.Contrary to popular belief, his doubts were not due to a conviction that God "is not playing at dice".Indeed, it was Einstein himself, in his 1917 paper that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, who first proposed the fundamental role of chance in explaining quantum processes.Rather, he objected to what quantum mechanics implies about the nature of reality.Einstein believed that a physical reality exists independent of our ability to observe it.In contrast, Bohr and his followers maintained that all we can know are the results of measurements and observations, and that it makes no sense to speculate about an ultimate reality that exists beyond our perceptions.-- -- -- -- Bohr versus Einstein  -- -- -- --

 The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Einstein and Niels Bohr, who were two of its founders.Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science.Their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics.-- -- -- -- Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox  -- -- -- --

In 1935, Einstein returned quantum mechanics, in particular to the question of its completeness, in the "EPR paper".In a thought experiment, he considered two particles which had interacted such that their properties were strongly correlated.No matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle; likewise a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way.Given Einstein's concept of local realism, there were two possibilities: (1) either the other particle had these properties already determined, or (2) the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle.Einstein rejected this second possibility (popularly called "spooky action at a distance").Einstein's belief in local realism led him to assert that, while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question, it must be incomplete.But as a physical principle, local realism was shown to be incorrect when the Aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed Bell's theorem, which J. S. Bell had delineated in 1964.The results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which "particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities, each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated."Although Einstein was wrong about local realism, his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite, entangled quantum states, has resulted in the EPR paper becoming among the top ten papers published in Physical Review.It is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory.-- -- -- Unified field theory  -- -- --

Following his research on general relativity, Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity.In 1950, he described his "unified field theory" in a Scientific American article titled "On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation".Although he continued to be lauded for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.

Iron Maiden's 1980 7-inch single "Sanctuary" was a re-recording of a song that had been given for use on the Metal For Muthas compilation the previous year.The recording was made during the Iron Maiden sessions but was left off the UK version of that album, and was then put out as a single.To help compensate fans who had specifically bought Metal for Muthas for the track, the "Sanctuary" single had two live B-sides which were deliberately selected to be non-album tracks—"I've Got The Fire" (a cover of the Montrose song) and "Drifter".A studio recording of "Drifter" (featuring Adrian Smith instead of Dennis Stratton) appeared on their next album, Killers, and a studio version of "I've Got The Fire" featuring Bruce Dickinson appeared on the B-side of "Flight of Icarus" a few years later.At the time this single was released they were the first live Iron Maiden tracks released (though more would follow), and it remains the only officially released recording of "I've Got The Fire" with Paul Di'Anno on vocals.The singles from U2's album The Joshua Tree were released with two B-side songs each, which were pressed at 33​1⁄3 rpm.Versions for jukeboxes included only one of those songs, which played at 45 rpm.The UK 7-inch single of "Love Shack" by The B-52's was released with live versions of "Planet Claire" and "Rock Lobster" on the B-side, which plays at 33​1⁄3 rpm.The follow-up "Roam" followed suit, including live versions of "Whammy Kiss" and "Dance This Mess Around" on the B-side playing at 33​1⁄3 rpm.The Rolling Stones released "Brown Sugar" from their album Sticky Fingers in May 1971.While the American single featured only "Bitch" as the B-side, the British single added a third track, a live rendition of "Let It Rock" (the Chuck Berry classic) recorded at the University of Leeds during their 1971 tour of the UK.-- -- Humorous implementations  -- --
The concept of the B-side has become so well known that many performers have released parody versions, including:

The 1988 single "Stutter Rap (No Sleep til Bedtime)" by parody band Morris Minor and the Majors featured a B-side titled "Another Boring 'B'-side".Parody band Bad News recorded a video B-side for the VHS version of their single "Bohemian Rhapsody", titled "Every Mistake Imaginable", in which the band discusses that they have to record an extra three minutes of footage for the single to be eligible for the charts.Tracey Ullman's hit "They Don't Know" was backed in the UK by a song entitled "The B Side" and featured Ullman in a variety of comic monologues, many of which bemoaned the uselessness of B-sides.(The US release used the album's title track, "You Broke My Heart in 17 Places", as the B-side.)Paul and Linda McCartney's B-side to Linda McCartney's "Seaside Woman" (released under the alias Suzy and the Red Stripes) was a song called "B-Side to Seaside".The single "O.K.?", from the soundtrack album of the TV series Rock Follies of '77, contained a song called "B-Side?"which featured Charlotte Cornwell tunelessly singing about the fact that she is not considered good enough to sing an A-side.The B-side of the single "They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!"by Napoleon XIV was called "!aaaH-aH, yawA eM ekaT oT gnimoC er'yehT" and the singer billed as "Noelopan VIX".It was the A-side played in reverse; in fact, most of the label affixed to that B-side was a mirror image of the front label (as opposed to being spelled backwards), including the letters in the "WB" shield logo.Blotto's 1981 single "When the Second Feature Starts" features "The B-Side", a song about how bad B-sides are compared to A-sides.Love and Rockets' novelty side project the Bubblemen released only one single in 1988, "The Bubblemen Are Coming" coupled with "The B-Side", which is a field recording of bees.The Wall of Voodoo 1982 12-inch EP Two Songs by Wall of Voodoo has the 10-minute joke track "There's Nothing on This Side" on the B-side.Metric released in 2008 a single entitled "Help, I'm Alive", with a B-side "Help, I'm a B-Side".Three Dog Night's 1973 single "Shambala" featured "Our 'B' Side", about the group wishing it could be trusted to write their own songs for single release.It is the only Three Dog Night single written and produced by the whole group, and features family members on background vocals.Dickie Goodman's 1974 release "Energy Crisis '74" featured "The Mistake" as the B-side, which was simply a false start of the A-side, with Goodman saying, "Mr. President, the crisis...", followed by two minutes of silence.

In his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces, which were not well understood until many years after his death.Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification.Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.-- -- -- Other investigations  -- -- --

In addition to longtime collaborators Leopold Infeld, Nathan Rosen, Peter Bergmann and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.-- -- -- -- Einstein–de Haas experiment  -- -- -- --

Einstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin.In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum.They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes.This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.-- -- -- -- Schrödinger gas model  -- -- -- --
Einstein suggested to Erwin Schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a Bose–Einstein gas by considering a box.Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator.Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.This formulation is a form of second quantization, but it predates modern quantum mechanics.Erwin Schrödinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas.Schrödinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.-- -- -- -- Einstein refrigerator  -- -- -- --

In 1926, Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the Einstein refrigerator.This absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input.On 11 November 1930, U.S. Patent 1,781,541 was awarded to Einstein and Leó Szilárd for the refrigerator.Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company Electrolux.-- -- Non-scientific legacy  -- --
While traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse.The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to The Hebrew University.Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986).Einstein had expressed his interest in the plumbing profession and was made an honorary member of the Plumbers and Steamfitters Union.Barbara Wolff, of The Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.Corbis, successor to The Roger Richman Agency, licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the university.-- -- In popular culture  -- --

In the period before World War II, The New Yorker published a vignette in their "The Talk of the Town" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain "that theory".He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries.

The 32-bar form, also known as the AABA song form, American popular song form and the ballad form, is a song structure commonly found in Tin Pan Alley songs and other American popular music, especially in the first half of the 20th century.As its alternative name AABA implies, this song form consists of four sections: an eight-bar A section; a second eight-bar A section (which may have slight changes from the first A section); an eight-bar B section, often with contrasting harmony or "feel"; and a final eight-bar A section.The core melody line is generally retained in each A section, although variations may be added, particularly for the last A section.Examples of 32-bar AABA form songs include "Over the Rainbow", "What'll I Do", "Make You Feel My Love", "Blue Skies", and Willie Nelson's "Crazy".Many show tunes that have become jazz standards are 32-bar song forms.-- -- Basic song form  -- --
At its core, the basic AABA 32-bar song form consists of four sections, each section being 8 bars in length, totaling 32 bars.Each of these 8-bar sections is assigned a letter name ("A" or "B"), based on its melodic and harmonic content.The A sections all share the same melody (possibly with slight variations), and the recurring title lyric typically falls on either the first or last line of each A section.The "B" section musically and lyrically contrasts the A sections, and may or may not contain the title lyric.The "B" section may use a different harmony that contrasts with the harmony of the A sections.For example in the song "I've Got Rhythm", the A sections are in the key of B♭, but the B section involves a circle of fifths series of dominant seventh chords going from D7, G7, C7 to F7.Song form terminology is not standardized, and the B section is also referred to as the "middle eight", "bridge", or "primary bridge".The song form of "What'll I Do" by Irving Berlin is as follows:


 -- -- Terminology  -- --


 -- -- -- Sectional verse  -- -- --
Some Tin Pan Alley songs composed as numbers for musicals precede the main tune with what was called a "sectional verse" or "introductory verse" in the terminology of the early 20th century.This introductory section is usually sixteen bars long and establishes the background and mood of the number, and is musically undistinguished in order to highlight the attractions of the main tune.The sectional verse is often omitted from modern performances.It is not assigned a letter in the "AABA" naming scheme.The introductory verse from "What'll I Do" by Irving Berlin is as follows:

Gone is the romance that was so divine,
'tis broken and cannot be mended
You must go your way, and I must go mine,
but now that our love dreams have ended...


 -- -- -- Bridge  -- -- --

In music theory, the middle 8 or bridge is the B section of a 32-bar form.This section has a significantly different melody from the rest of the song and usually occurs after the second "A" section in the AABA song form.It is called a middle 8 because it happens in the middle of the song and the length is generally eight bars.-- -- -- Terminological confusion  -- -- --
In early 20th century terminology, the main 32-bar AABA section, in its entirety, was called the "refrain" or "chorus".This is in contrast to the modern usage of the term "chorus", which refers to a repeating musical and lyrical section in verse–chorus form.Additionally, "verse," "chorus" and "refrain" all have different meanings in modern musical terminology.See the below chart for clarification:


 -- -- History  -- --
Though the 32-bar form resembles the ternary form of the operatic da capo aria, it did not become common until the late 1910s.

Aesthetics, or esthetics () : is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of art, beauty and taste, with the creation or appreciation of beauty : a particular theory or conception of beauty or art : a particular taste for or approach to what is pleasing to the senses and especially sight.In its more technical epistemological perspective, it is defined as the study of subjective and sensori-emotional values, or sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste.Aesthetics studies how artists imagine, create and perform works of art; how people use, enjoy, and criticize art; and what happens in their minds when they look at paintings, listen to music, or read poetry, and understand what they see and hear.It also studies how they feel about art, why they like some works and not others, and how art can affect their moods, beliefs, and attitude toward life.More broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics as "critical reflection on art, culture and nature".In modern English, the term aesthetic can also refer to a set of principles underlying the works of a particular art movement or theory: one speaks, for example, of the Cubist aesthetic.-- -- Etymology  -- --
The word aesthetic is derived from the Greek αἰσθητικός (aisthetikos, meaning "esthetic, sensitive, sentient, pertaining to sense perception"), which in turn was derived from αἰσθάνομαι (aisthanomai, meaning "I perceive, feel, sense" and related to αἴσθησις (aisthēsis, "sensation").Aesthetics in this central sense has been said to start with the series of articles on “The Pleasures of the Imagination” which the journalist Joseph Addison wrote in the early issues of the magazine The Spectator in 1712.The term "aesthetics" was appropriated and coined with new meaning by the German philosopher Alexander Baumgarten in his dissertation Meditationes philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema pertinentibus ("Philosophical considerations of some matters pertaining the poem") in 1735;  Baumgarten chose "aesthetics" because he wished to emphasize the experience of art as a means of knowing.Aesthetics, a not very tidy intellectual discipline, is a heterogeneous collection of problems that concern the arts primarily but also relate to nature.even though his later definition in the fragment Aesthetica (1750) is more often referred to as the first definition of modern aesthetics.-- -- Aesthetics and the philosophy of art  -- --
Aesthetics is for the artist as Ornithology is for the birds.Some separate aesthetics and philosophy of art, claiming that the former is the study of beauty while the latter is the study of works of art.However, most commonly Aesthetics encompasses both questions around beauty as well as questions about art.It examines topics such as aesthetic objects,  aesthetic experience, and aesthetic judgments.For some, aesthetics is considered a synonym for the philosophy of art since Hegel, while others insist that there is a significant distinction between these closely related fields.In practice, aesthetic judgement refers to the sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object (not necessarily an art object), while artistic judgement refers to the recognition, appreciation or criticism of art or an art work.Philosophical aesthetics not only has to speak about art and to produce judgments about art works, but also has to give a definition of what art is.Art is an autonomous entity for philosophy, because art deals with the senses (i.e.the etymology of aesthetics) and art is as such free of any moral or political purpose.Hence, there are two different conceptions of art in aesthetics: art as knowledge or art as action, but aesthetics is neither epistemology nor ethics.Aestheticians compare historical developments with theoretical approaches to the arts of many periods.They study the varieties of art in relation to their physical, social, and culture environments.Aestheticians also use psychology to understand how people see, hear, imagine, think, learn, and act in relation to the materials and problems of art.Aesthetic psychology studies the creative process and the aesthetic experience.-- -- Aesthetic judgment, universals and ethics  -- --


 -- -- -- Aesthetic judgment  -- -- --
Aesthetics examines our affective domain response to an object or phenomenon.Judgments of aesthetic value rely on our ability to discriminate at a sensory level.However, aesthetic judgments usually go beyond sensory discrimination.

For David Hume, delicacy of taste is not merely "the ability to detect all the ingredients in a composition", but also our sensitivity "to pains as well as pleasures, which escape the rest of mankind."Thus, the sensory discrimination is linked to capacity for pleasure.For Immanuel Kant  (Critique of Judgment, 1790), "enjoyment" is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but judging something to be "beautiful" has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our capacities of reflective contemplation.Judgments of beauty are sensory, emotional and intellectual all at once.Kant (1790) observed of a man "If he says that canary wine is agreeable he is quite content if someone else corrects his terms and reminds him to say instead: It is agreeable to me," because "Everyone has his own (sense of) taste".The case of "beauty" is different from mere "agreeableness" because, "If he proclaims something to be beautiful, then he requires the same liking from others; he then judges not just for himself but for everyone, and speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things."Viewer interpretations of beauty may on occasion be observed to possess two concepts of value: aesthetics and taste.Aesthetics is the philosophical notion of beauty.Taste is a result of an education process and awareness of elite cultural values learned through exposure to mass culture.Bourdieu examined how the elite in society define the aesthetic values like taste and how varying levels of exposure to these values can result in variations by class, cultural background, and education.According to Kant, beauty is subjective and universal; thus certain things are beautiful to everyone.In the opinion of Władysław Tatarkiewicz, there are six conditions for the presentation of art: beauty, form, representation, reproduction of reality, artistic expression and innovation.However, one may not be able to pin down these qualities in a work of art.-- -- -- -- Factors involved in aesthetic judgment  -- -- -- --

Judgments of aesthetical values seem often to involve many other kinds of issues as well.Responses such as disgust show that sensory detection is linked in instinctual ways to facial expressions, and even behaviours like the gag reflex.Yet disgust can often be a learned or cultural issue too; as Darwin pointed out, seeing a stripe of soup in a man's beard is disgusting even though neither soup nor beards are themselves disgusting.Aesthetic judgments may be linked to emotions or, like emotions, partially embodied in our physical reactions.For example, the awe inspired by a sublime landscape might physically manifest with an increased heart-rate or pupil dilation; physiological reaction may express or even cause the initial awe.As seen, emotions are conformed to 'cultural' reactions, therefore aesthetics is always characterized by 'regional responses', as Francis Grose was the first to affirm in his ‘Rules for Drawing Caricaturas: With an Essay on Comic Painting’ (1788), published in W. Hogarth, The Analysis of Beauty, Bagster, London s.d.(1791?[1753]), pp.1–24.Francis Grose can therefore be claimed to be the first critical 'aesthetic regionalist' in proclaiming the anti-universality of aesthetics in contrast to the perilous and always resurgent dictatorship of beauty.'Aesthetic Regionalism' can thus be seen as a political statement and stance which vies against any universal notion of beauty to safeguard the counter-tradition of aesthetics related to what has usually been considered and dubbed un-beautiful just because one's culture does not contemplate it, e.g.

E. Burke's sublime, what is usually defined as 'primitive' art, or un-harmonious, non-cathartic art, camp art, which 'beauty' posits and creates, dichotomously, as its opposite, without even the need of formal statements, but which will be 'perceived' as ugly.Likewise, aesthetic judgments may be culturally conditioned to some extent.Victorians in Britain often saw African sculpture as ugly, but just a few decades later, Edwardian audiences saw the same sculptures as being beautiful.Evaluations of beauty may well be linked to desirability, perhaps even to sexual desirability.Thus, judgments of aesthetic value can become linked to judgments of economic, political, or moral value.In a current context, one might judge a Lamborghini to be beautiful partly because it is desirable as a status symbol, or we might judge it to be repulsive partly because it signifies for us over-consumption and offends our political or moral values.Aesthetic judgments can often be very fine-grained and internally contradictory.Likewise aesthetic judgments seem often to be at least partly intellectual and interpretative.It is what a thing means or symbolizes for us that is often what we are judging.Modern aestheticians have asserted that will and desire were almost dormant in aesthetic experience, yet preference and choice have seemed important aesthetics to some 20th-century thinkers.The point is already made by Hume, but see Mary Mothersill, "Beauty and the Critic's Judgment", in The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics, 2004.Thus aesthetic judgments might be seen to be based on the senses, emotions, intellectual opinions, will, desires, culture, preferences, values, subconscious behaviour, conscious decision, training, instinct, sociological institutions, or some complex combination of these, depending on exactly which theory one employs.A third major topic in the study of aesthetic judgments is how they are unified across art forms.For instance, the source of a painting's beauty has a different character to that of beautiful music, suggesting their aesthetics differ in kind.The distinct inability of language to express aesthetic judgment and the role of Social construction further cloud this issue.-- -- -- Aesthetic universals  -- -- --
The philosopher Denis Dutton identified six universal signatures in human aesthetics:
Expertise or virtuosity.Humans cultivate, recognize, and admire technical artistic skills.Nonutilitarian pleasure.People enjoy art for art's sake, and do not demand that it keep them warm or put food on the table.Style.Artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in a recognizable style.Criticism.People make a point of judging, appreciating, and interpreting works of art.Imitation.With a few important exceptions like abstract painting, works of art simulate experiences of the world.

During the 20th century there was a huge increase in the variety of music that people had access to.Prior to the invention of mass market gramophone records (developed in 1892) and radio broadcasting (first commercially done ca.1919–20), people mainly listened to music at live Classical music concerts or musical theatre shows, which were too expensive for many lower-income people; on early phonograph players (a technology invented in 1877 which was not mass-marketed until the mid-1890s); or by individuals performing music or singing songs on an amateur basis at home, using sheet music, which required the ability to sing, play, and read music.These were skills that tended to be limited to middle-class and upper-class individuals.With the mass-market availability of gramophone records and radio broadcasts, listeners could purchase recordings of, or listen on radio to recordings or live broadcasts of a huge variety of songs and musical pieces from around the globe.This enabled a much wider range of the population to listen to performances of Classical music symphonies and operas that they would not be able to hear live, either due to not being able to afford live-concert tickets or because such music was not performed in their region.Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be inexpensively and widely distributed nationwide or even, for some artists, worldwide.The development of relatively inexpensive reproduction of music via a succession of formats including vinyl records, compact cassettes, compact discs (introduced in 1983) and, by the mid-1990s, digital audio recordings, and the transmission or broadcast of audio recordings of music performances on radio, of video recordings or live performances on television, and by the 1990s, of audio and video recordings via the Internet, using file sharing of digital audio recordings, gave individuals from a wide range of socioeconomic classes access to a diverse selection of high-quality music performances by artists from around the world.The introduction of multitrack recording in 1955 and the use of mixing had a major influence on pop and rock music, because it enabled record producers to mix and overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.The development of sound recording and audio engineering technologies and the ability to edit these recordings gave rise to new subgenres of classical music, including the Musique concrète (1949) and acousmatic (1955) schools of electronic composition.In the 1970s, African-American hip hop musicians began to use the record turntable as a musical instrument, creating rhythmic and percussive "scratching" effects by manipulating a vinyl record on the turntable.In Beethoven's and Felix Mendelssohn's time in the 19th century, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments which was very rarely modified.As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as Berlioz and Mahler, the 20th century saw that instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer.Saxophones were used in some 20th-century orchestra scores such as Vaughan Williams' Symphonies No.6 and 9 and William Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble.Twentieth-century orchestras  generally include a string section, woodwinds, brass instruments, percussion, piano, celeste, harp(s), with other instruments called for occasionally, such as electric guitar and electric bass.The 20th century saw dramatic innovations in musical forms and styles.Composers and songwriters explored new forms and sounds that challenged the previously accepted rules of music of earlier periods, such as the use of altered chords and extended chords in 1940s-era Bebop jazz.The development of powerful, loud guitar amplifiers and sound reinforcement systems in the 1960s and 1970s permitted bands to hold large concerts where even those with the least expensive tickets could hear the show.Composers and songwriters experimented with new musical styles, such as genre fusions (e.g., the late 1960s fusion of jazz and rock music to create jazz fusion).As well, composers and musicians used new electric, electronic, and digital instruments and musical devices.In the 1980s, some styles of music, such as electronic dance music genres such as house music were created largely with synthesizers and drum machines.Faster modes of transportation such as jet flight allowed musicians and fans to travel more widely to perform or hear shows, which increased the spread of musical styles.

Special focus.Art is set aside from ordinary life and made a dramatic focus of experience.Artists such as Thomas Hirschhorn have indicated that there are too many exceptions to Dutton's categories.For example, Hirschhorn's installations deliberately eschew technical virtuosity.People can appreciate a Renaissance Madonna for aesthetic reasons, but such objects often had (and sometimes still have) specific devotional functions."Rules of composition" that might be read into Duchamp's Fountain or John Cage's 4′33″ do not locate the works in a recognizable style (or certainly not a style recognizable at the time of the works' realization).Moreover, some of Dutton's categories seem too broad: a physicist might entertain hypothetical worlds in his/her imagination in the course of formulating a theory.Another problem is that Dutton's categories seek to universalize traditional European notions of aesthetics and art forgetting that, as André Malraux and others have pointed out, there have been large numbers of cultures in which such ideas (including the idea "art" itself) were non-existent.-- -- -- Aesthetic ethics  -- -- --
Aesthetic ethics refers to the idea that human conduct and behaviour ought to be governed by that which is beautiful and attractive.John Dewey has pointed out that the unity of aesthetics and ethics is in fact reflected in our understanding of behaviour being "fair"—the word having a double meaning of attractive and morally acceptable.More recently, James Page has suggested that aesthetic ethics might be taken to form a philosophical rationale for peace education.-- -- New Criticism and "The Intentional Fallacy"  -- --
During the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other.This resulted in the rise of the New Criticism school and debate concerning the intentional fallacy.At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.In 1946, William K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "The Intentional Fallacy", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an author's intention, or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work.For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.In another essay, "The Affective Fallacy," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text.This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the reader-response school of literary theory.One of the leading theorists from this school, Stanley Fish, was himself trained by New Critics.Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).As summarized by Berys Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms' assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic."These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art.So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works."They quote Richard Wollheim as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."-- -- Derivative forms of aesthetics  -- --
A large number of derivative forms of aesthetics have developed as contemporary and transitory forms of inquiry associated with the field of aesthetics which include the post-modern, psychoanalytic, scientific, and mathematical among others.

 -- -- -- Modernism  -- -- --

In the early 20th century, many composers, including Rachmaninoff, Richard Strauss, Giacomo Puccini, and Edward Elgar, continued to work in forms and in a musical language that derived from the 19th century.However, modernism in music became increasingly prominent and important; among the most important modernists were Alexander Scriabin, Claude Debussy, and post-Wagnerian composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss, who experimented with form, tonality and orchestration.Busoni, Stravinsky, Schoenberg, and Schreker were already recognized before 1914 as modernists, and Ives was retrospectively also included in this category for his challenges to the uses of tonality.Composers such as Ravel, Milhaud, and Gershwin combined classical and jazz idioms.-- -- -- Nationalism  -- -- --

Late-Romantic and modernist nationalism was found also in British, American, and Latin-American music of the early 20th century.Composers such as Ralph Vaughan Williams, Aaron Copland, Alberto Ginastera, Carlos Chávez, Silvestre Revueltas, and Heitor Villa-Lobos used folk themes collected by themselves or others in many of their major compositions.-- -- -- Microtonal music  -- -- --

In the early decades of the 20th century, composers such as Julián Carrillo, Mildred Couper, Alois Hába, Charles Ives, Erwin Schulhoff, Ivan Wyschnegradsky turned their attention to quarter tones (24 equal intervals per octave), and other finer divisions.In the middle of the century composers such as Harry Partch and Ben Johnston explored just intonation.In the second half of the century, prominent composers employing microtonality included Easley Blackwood, Jr., Wendy Carlos, Adriaan Fokker, Terry Riley, Ezra Sims, Karlheinz Stockhausen, La Monte Young, and Iannis Xenakis.-- -- -- Neoclassicism  -- -- --

A dominant trend in music composed from 1923 to 1950 was neoclassicism, a reaction against the exaggerated gestures and formlessness of late Romanticism which revived the balanced forms and clearly perceptible thematic processes of earlier styles.There were three distinct "schools" of neoclassicism, associated with Igor Stravinsky, Paul Hindemith, and Arnold Schoenberg.Similar sympathies in the second half of the century are generally subsumed under the heading "postmodernism".-- -- -- Experimental music  -- -- --

A compositional tradition arose in the mid-20th century—particularly in North America—called "experimental music".Its most famous and influential exponent was John Cage (1912–1992).According to Cage, "an experimental action is one the outcome of which is not foreseen", and he was specifically interested in completed works that performed an unpredictable action.Some of the composers who influenced John Cage were Erik Satie (1866–1925), Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951) and Henry Dixon Cowell (1897–1965).-- -- -- Minimalism  -- -- --

Minimalist music, involving a simplification of materials and intensive repetition of motives began in the late 1950s with the composers Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass.Later, minimalism was adapted to a more traditional symphonic setting by composers including Reich, Glass, and John Adams.Minimalism was practiced heavily throughout the latter half of the century and has carried over into the 21st century, as well as composers like Arvo Pärt, Henryk Górecki and John Tavener working in the holy minimalism variant.For more examples see List of 20th-century classical composers.-- -- -- Contemporary classical music  -- -- --

Contemporary classical music can be understood as belonging to the period that started in the mid-1970s to early 1990s, which includes modernist, postmodern, neoromantic, and pluralist music.

Early-twentieth-century artists, poets and composers challenged existing notions of beauty, broadening the scope of art and aesthetics.In 1941, Eli Siegel, American philosopher and poet, founded Aesthetic Realism, the philosophy that reality itself is aesthetic, and that "The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites."Various attempts have been made to define Post-Modern Aesthetics.The challenge to the assumption that beauty was central to art and aesthetics, thought to be original, is actually continuous with older aesthetic theory; Aristotle was the first in the Western tradition to classify "beauty" into types as in his theory of drama, and Kant made a distinction between beauty and the sublime.What was new was a refusal to credit the higher status of certain types, where the taxonomy implied a preference for tragedy and the sublime to comedy and the Rococo.Croce suggested that "expression" is central in the way that beauty was once thought to be central.George Dickie suggested that the sociological institutions of the art world were the glue binding art and sensibility into unities.Marshall McLuhan suggested that art always functions as a "counter-environment" designed to make visible what is usually invisible about a society.Theodor Adorno felt that aesthetics could not proceed without confronting the role of the culture industry in the commodification of art and aesthetic experience.Hal Foster attempted to portray the reaction against beauty and Modernist art in The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture.Arthur Danto has described this reaction as "kalliphobia" (after the Greek word for beauty, κάλλος kallos).André Malraux explains that the notion of beauty was connected to a particular conception of art that arose with the Renaissance and was still dominant in the eighteenth century (but was supplanted later).The discipline of aesthetics, which originated in the eighteenth century, mistook this transient state of affairs for a revelation of the permanent nature of art.Brian Massumi suggests to reconsider beauty following the aesthetical thought in the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari.Walter Benjamin echoed Malraux in believing aesthetics was a comparatively recent invention, a view proven wrong in the late 1970s, when Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake analyzed links between beauty, information processing, and information theory.Denis Dutton in "The Art Instinct" also proposed that an aesthetic sense was a vital evolutionary factor.Jean-François Lyotard re-invokes the Kantian distinction between taste and the sublime.Sublime painting, unlike kitsch realism, "... will enable us to see only by making it impossible to see; it will please only by causing pain."Sigmund Freud inaugurated aesthetical thinking in Psychoanalysis mainly via the "Uncanny" as aesthetical affect.Following Freud and Merleau-Ponty, Jacques Lacan theorized aesthetics in terms of sublimation and the Thing.The relation of Marxist aesthetics to post-modern aesthetics is still a contentious area of debate.-- -- -- Recent aesthetics  -- -- --
Guy Sircello has pioneered efforts in analytic philosophy to develop a rigorous theory of aesthetics, focusing on the concepts of beauty, love and sublimity.In contrast to romantic theorists Sircello argued for the objectivity of beauty and formulated a theory of love on that basis.British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art aesthetics, Peter Osborne, makes the point that "'post-conceptual art' aesthetic does not concern a particular type of contemporary art so much as the historical-ontological condition for the production of contemporary art in general ...".Osborne noted that contemporary art is 'post-conceptual' in a public lecture delivered in 2010.

However, the term  may also be employed in a broader sense to refer to all post-1945 musical forms.Many composers working in the early 21st century were prominent figures in the 20th century.Some younger composers such as Oliver Knussen, Wolfgang Rihm, Georg Friedrich Haas, Judith Weir, George Benson, Richard Barrett, Simon Bainbridge, John Luther Adams, Toshio Hosokawa, Bright Sheng, Kaija Saariaho, Tan Dun, Magnus Lindberg, Philippe Manoury, Olga Neuwirth, Rebecca Saunders, David Lang, Hanspeter Kyburz, James MacMillan, Mark-Anthony Turnage, Thomas Adès, Marc-André Dalbavie, Unsuk Chin, Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf, and Michael Daugherty did not rise to prominence until late in the 20th century.For more examples see List of 21st-century classical composers.-- -- Electronic music  -- --

For centuries, instrumental music had either been created by singing, or using mechanical music technologies, such as drawing a bow across a string that is strung on a hollow instrument or plucking taut gut or metal strings (string instruments), constricting vibrating air (woodwinds and brass) or hitting something to make rhythmic sounds (percussion instruments).In the early twentieth century, electronic devices were invented that were capable of generating sound electronically, without an initial mechanical source of vibration.As early as the 1930s, composers such as Olivier Messiaen incorporated electronic instruments into live performance.While sound recording technology is often associated with the key role it played in enabling the creation and mass marketing of popular music, new electric and electronic sound recording technology was used to produce art music, as well.The musique concrète (French: “concrete music”), developed about 1948 by Pierre Schaeffer and his associates, was an experimental technique using recorded sounds as raw material.In the years following World War II, some composers were quick to adopt developing electronic technology.Electronic music was embraced by composers such as Edgard Varèse, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Milton Babbitt, Pierre Boulez, Bruno Maderna, Henri Pousseur, Karel Goeyvaerts, Ernst Krenek, Luigi Nono, Luciano Berio, Herbert Brün, and Iannis Xenakis.In the 1950s the film industry also began to make extensive use of electronic soundtracks.Major rock groups that were early adopters of synthesizers include The Moody Blues, The Beatles, The Monkees, and The Doors.-- -- Folk music  -- --

Folk music, in the original sense of the term as coined in the 18th century by Johann Gottfried Herder, is music produced by communal composition and possessing dignity, though by the late 19th century the concept of ‘folk’ had become a synonym for ‘nation’, usually identified as peasants and rural artisans, as in the Merrie England movement and the Irish and Scottish Gaelic Revivals of the 1880s.Folk music was normally shared and performed by the entire community (not by a special class of expert or professional performers, possibly excluding the idea of amateurs), and was transmitted by word of mouth (oral tradition).In addition, folk music was also borrowed by composers in other genres.Some of the work of Aaron Copland clearly draws on American folk music.An important work on registering traditional tunes of the Balkanic region was that of Béla Bartók since it is probably the first composer who was interested in recording audios as well as analysing them from an ethnological point of view.-- -- -- Bluegrass music  -- -- --

Bluegrass music is a form of American roots music, and a related genre of country music.Influenced by the music of Appalachia, Bluegrass has mixed roots in Irish, Scottish, Welsh,  and English traditional music, and was also later influenced by the music of African-Americans through incorporation of jazz elements.Settlers from the United Kingdom and Ireland arrived in Appalachia during the 18th century, and brought with them the musical traditions of their homelands.These traditions consisted primarily of English and Scottish ballads—which were essentially unaccompanied narrative—and dance music, such as Irish reels, which were accompanied by a fiddle.Many older bluegrass songs come directly from the British Isles.Several Appalachian bluegrass ballads, such as "Pretty Saro", "Barbara Allen", "Cuckoo Bird" and "House Carpenter", come from England and preserve the English ballad tradition both melodically and lyrically.Others, such as The Twa Sisters, also come from England; however, the lyrics are about Ireland.

Gary Tedman has put forward a theory of a subjectless aesthetics derived from Karl Marx's concept of alienation, and Louis Althusser's antihumanism, using elements of Freud's group psychology, defining a concept of the 'aesthetic level of practice'.Gregory Loewen has suggested that the subject is key in the interaction with the aesthetic object.The work of art serves as a vehicle for the projection of the individual's identity into the world of objects, as well as being the irruptive source of much of what is uncanny in modern life.As well, art is used to memorialize individuated biographies in a manner that allows persons to imagine that they are part of something greater than themselves.-- -- -- Aesthetics and science  -- -- --

The field of experimental aesthetics was founded by Gustav Theodor Fechner in the 19th century.Experimental aesthetics in these times had been characterized by a subject-based, inductive approach.The analysis of individual experience and behaviour based on experimental methods is a central part of experimental aesthetics.In particular, the perception of works of art, music, or modern items such as websites or other IT products is studied.Experimental aesthetics is strongly oriented towards the natural sciences.Modern approaches mostly come from the fields of cognitive psychology or neuroscience (neuroaesthetics).In the 1970s, Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake were among the first to analyze links between aesthetics, information processing, and information theory.In the 1990s, Jürgen Schmidhuber described an algorithmic theory of beauty which takes the subjectivity of the observer into account and postulates: among several observations classified as comparable by a given subjective observer, the aesthetically most pleasing one is the one with the shortest description, given the observer's previous knowledge and his particular method for encoding the data.This is closely related to the principles of algorithmic information theory and minimum description length.One of his examples: mathematicians enjoy simple proofs with a short description in their formal language.Another very concrete example describes an aesthetically pleasing human face whose proportions can be described by very few bits of information, drawing inspiration from less detailed 15th century proportion studies by Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Dürer.Schmidhuber's theory explicitly distinguishes between what's beautiful and what's interesting, stating that interestingness corresponds to the first derivative of subjectively perceived beauty.Here the premise is that any observer continually tries to improve the predictability and compressibility of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and symmetries and fractal self-similarity.Whenever the observer's learning process (which may be a predictive artificial neural network; see also Neuroesthetics) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer bits than before, the temporary interestingness of the data corresponds to the number of saved bits.This compression progress is proportional to the observer's internal reward, also called curiosity reward.A reinforcement learning algorithm is used to maximize future expected reward by learning to execute action sequences that cause additional interesting input data with yet unknown but learnable predictability or regularity.The principles can be implemented on artificial agents which then exhibit a form of artificial curiosity.-- -- -- Truth in beauty and mathematics  -- -- --
Mathematical considerations, such as symmetry and complexity, are used for analysis in theoretical aesthetics.This is different from the aesthetic considerations of applied aesthetics used in the study of mathematical beauty.Aesthetic considerations such as symmetry and simplicity are used in areas of philosophy, such as ethics and theoretical physics and cosmology to define truth, outside of empirical considerations.Beauty and Truth have been argued to be nearly synonymous, as reflected in the statement "Beauty is truth, truth beauty" in the poem Ode on a Grecian Urn by John Keats, or by the Hindu motto "Satyam Shivam Sundaram" (Satya (Truth) is Shiva (God), and Shiva is Sundaram (Beautiful)).The fact that judgments of beauty and judgments of truth both are influenced by processing fluency, which is the ease with which information can be processed, has been presented as an explanation for why beauty is sometimes equated with truth.

Some bluegrass fiddle songs popular in Appalachia, such as "Leather Britches", and "Pretty Polly", have Scottish roots.The dance tune Cumberland Gap may be derived from the tune that accompanies the Scottish ballad Bonnie George Campbell.Other songs have different names in different places; for instance in England there is an old ballad known as "A Brisk Young Sailor Courted Me", but exactly the same song in North American bluegrass is known as "I Wish My Baby Was Born".In bluegrass, as in some forms of jazz, one or more instruments each takes its turn playing the melody and improvising around it, while the others perform  accompaniment; this is especially typified in tunes called breakdowns.This is in contrast to old-time music, in which all instruments play the melody together or one instrument carries the lead throughout while the others provide accompaniment.Breakdowns are often characterized by rapid tempos and unusual instrumental dexterity and sometimes by complex chord changes.There are three major subgenres of bluegrass and one unofficial subgenre.Traditional bluegrass has musicians playing folk songs, tunes with simple traditional chord progressions, and using only acoustic instruments, with an example being Bill Monroe.Progressive bluegrass groups may use electric instruments and import songs from other genres, particularly rock & roll.Examples include Cadillac Sky and Bearfoot."Bluegrass gospel" has emerged as a third subgenre, which uses Christian lyrics, soulful three- or four-part harmony singing, and sometimes the playing of instrumentals.A newer development in the bluegrass world is Neo-traditional bluegrass; exemplified by bands such as The Grascals and Mountain Heart, bands from this subgenre typically have more than one lead singer.Bluegrass music has attracted a diverse following worldwide.Bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe characterized the genre as: "Scottish bagpipes and ole-time fiddlin'.It's Methodist and Holiness and Baptist.It's blues and jazz, and it has a high lonesome sound."-- -- Opera  -- --

In the early years of the century, Wagnerian chromatic harmony was extended by opera composers such as Richard Strauss (Salome, 1905; Elektra, 1906–1908; Der Rosenkavalier, 1910; Ariadne auf Naxos, 1912; Die Frau ohne Schatten, 1917), Claude Debussy (Pelléas et Mélisande, 1902), Giacomo Puccini (Madama Butterfly, 1904; La fanciulla del West, 1910; Il trittico, 1918), Ferruccio Busoni (Doktor Faust, 1916, posthumously completed by his student Philipp Jarnach), Béla Bartók (Bluebeard's Castle, 1911–17), Leos Janáček (Jenůfa, 1904; Osud, 1907; Kát´a Kabanová, 1919-1921) and Hans Pfitzner (Palestrina, 1917).Further extension of the chromatic language finally broke with tonality and moved into the style of atonal music in the early operas of Arnold Schoenberg (Erwartung, 1909; Die glückliche Hand, 1912) and his student Alban Berg (Wozzeck, 1925), both of whom adopted twelve-tone technique for their later operas: Schoenberg's Moses und Aron, and Berg’s Lulu.Neither of these operas were completed in their composers’ lifetimes, however, so that the first completed opera using the twelve-tone technique was Karl V (1938) by Ernst Krenek.Some of the most important operas of the twenties and thirties were composed by the Russian Dmitri Shostakovich (The Nose, 1928 and Ledi Makbet Mtsenkovo Uyezda [Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District], 1932).At the same time, the neoclassicism that became fashionable in the 1920s is represented by Stravinsky's opera buffa Mavra (1922) and his opera-oratorio Oedipus Rex (1927).Later in the century his last opera, The Rake's Progress (1951), also marks the end of the neoclassical phase of his compositions.Other operas of this period by composers identified as neoclassicists include Paul Hindemith's Mathis der Maler (1938), Sergei Prokofiev's Voina y Mir (War and Peace, 1941–1943), Bohuslav Martinu's Julietta aneb snár (1937) and Francis Poulenc's Les mamelles de Tirésias (1945).In the sixties, it should be noted, the Bernd Alois Zimmermann opera, Die Soldaten (1965), had a great impact.One of the most particular operas of the seventies was Le Grand Macabre, by György Ligeti.It deals with the subject of mortality through irony and collage.The most internationally accepted post–World War II composer of operas was Englishman Benjamin Britten (Peter Grimes, 1945; The Rape of Lucretia, 1946; Albert Herring, 1947; Billy Budd, 1951; Gloriana, 1953; The Turn of the Screw, 1954; A Midsummer Night's Dream, 1960; Owen Wingrave, 1970; Death in Venice, 1973)

In music, an accent is an emphasis, stress, or stronger attack placed on a particular note or set of notes, or chord, either as a result of its context or specifically indicated by an accent mark.Accents contribute to the articulation and prosody of a performance of a musical phrase.Accents may be written into a score or part by a composer or added by the performer as part of his or her interpretation of a musical piece.By default, in the music notation program Sibelius, "accents boost the dynamic by 50%."Compared to surrounding notes:

A dynamic accent or stress accent is an emphasis using louder sound or a stronger articulation, typically most pronounced on the attack of the sound.A tonic accent is an emphasis on notes by virtue of being higher in pitch as opposed to higher in volume.An agogic accent is an emphasis by virtue of being longer in duration.Accents which do not correspond to the stressed beats of the prevailing meter are said to be syncopated.For example, in common time, also called 4/4, the most common metre in popular music, the stressed beats are one and three.If chords or notes are played on beats two or four, this creates syncopation, as the music is emphasizing the "weak" beats of the bar.Syncopation is used in Classical music, popular music and traditional music.However, it is more prominent in blues, jazz, funk, disco and Latin music.-- -- Agogic  -- --
There are four kinds of agogic accents :

Longer notated duration of a note, for example, a whole note/semibreve (four beats in common time) among quarter notes/crotchets (each of which gets one beat).Extended duration of a note within its full-time value (without altering the tempo).For example, players of organ and harpsichord (which do not allow the use of dynamic accents) can emphasize one of a sequence of staccato quarter notes by making it less staccato (that is, making one note longer to emphasize it).Extended duration of a note with the effect of temporarily slowing down the tempo (rubato or rallentando).Delayed onset of a note, for example by doing a pause before starting a note.-- -- Marks  -- --
In music notation, an accent mark indicates a louder dynamic and a stronger attack to apply to a single note or an articulation mark.From left to right, the meanings of these articulation marks are explained below:

The most common symbol is the horizontal wedge, the first symbol in the diagram above.This is the symbol that most musicians mean when they say accent mark.It indicates that the marked note should have an emphasized beginning and then taper off rather quickly.

8tracks Founder David Porter claims his idea for a "music-oriented social network" has been in development since 1999 during his time in business school at Berkeley.However, this music-oriented social network was founded in 2006 and launched on August 8, 2008.One of Porter's major influences for the project was Napster, more specifically its "Hotlist" feature, which allowed users to add other users to their "hot list," consequently giving them access to that user's entire library.Also, after having spent 3 years prior to business school in London, Porter was fascinated by the social nature of the city's electronic music scene in which DJ's gained cult-like followings and augmented their following primarily through peer referral.Based on these concepts, Porter drafted a business plan entitled "Sampled & Sorted," which is now the name of his blog and was able to garner some initial attention for the project from venture capital firms.However, given his relative inexperience in the business world, Porter joined Live365, gained an understanding of their business model, their strengths and weaknesses, and was able to refine his original proposition.With the rise of Web 2.0, Porter finally decided to found 8tracks in the Fall of 2006, and after compiling a preliminary team, was able to launch the site on August 8, 2008.-- -- Usability  -- --

Acoustics is the branch of physics that deals with the study of all mechanical waves in gases, liquids, and solids including topics such as vibration, sound, ultrasound and infrasound.A scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an acoustician while someone working in the field of acoustics technology may be called an acoustical engineer.The application of acoustics is present in almost all aspects of modern society with the most obvious being the audio and noise control industries.Hearing is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world, and speech is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and culture.Accordingly, the science of acoustics spreads across many facets of human society—music, medicine, architecture, industrial production, warfare and more.Likewise, animal species such as songbirds and frogs use sound and hearing as a key element of mating rituals or marking territories.Art, craft, science and technology have provoked one another to advance the whole, as in many other fields of knowledge.Robert Bruce Lindsay's 'Wheel of Acoustics' is a well accepted overview of the various fields in acoustics.Acoustic music is a genre of music using instruments that produce sound solely through acoustic means, without electronic amplification.-- -- History  -- --


 -- -- -- Etymology  -- -- --
The word "acoustic" is derived from the Greek word ἀκουστικός (akoustikos), meaning "of or for hearing, ready to hear"and that from ἀκουστός (akoustos), "heard, audible", which in turn derives from the verb ἀκούω(akouo), "I hear".The Latin synonym is "sonic", after which the term sonics used to be a synonym for acoustics and later a branch of acoustics.Frequencies above and below the audible range are called "ultrasonic" and "infrasonic", respectively.-- -- -- Early research in acoustics  -- -- --

In the 6th century BC, the ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras wanted to know why some  combinations of musical sounds seemed more beautiful than others, and he found answers in terms of numerical ratios representing the harmonic overtone series on a string.He is reputed to have observed that when the lengths of vibrating strings are expressible as ratios of integers (e.g.2 to 3, 3 to 4), the tones produced will be harmonious, and the smaller the integers the more harmonious the sounds.If, for example, a string of a certain length would sound particularly harmonious with a string of twice the length (other factors being equal).In modern parlance, if a string sounds the note C when plucked, a string twice as long will sound a C an octave lower.In one system of musical tuning, the tones in between are then given by 16:9 for D, 8:5 for E, 3:2 for F, 4:3 for G, 6:5 for A, and 16:15 for B, in ascending order.Aristotle (384–322 BC) understood that sound consisted of compressions and rarefactions of air which "falls upon and strikes the air which is next to it...", a very good expression of the nature of wave motion.In about 20 BC, the Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius wrote a treatise on the acoustic properties of theaters including discussion of interference, echoes, and reverberation—the beginnings of architectural acoustics.In Book V of his De architectura (The Ten Books of Architecture) Vitruvius describes sound as a wave comparable to a water wave extended to three dimensions, which, when interrupted by obstructions, would flow back and break up following waves.He described the ascending seats in ancient theaters as designed to prevent this deterioration of sound and also recommended bronze vessels of appropriate sizes be placed in theaters to resonate with the fourth, fifth and so on, up to the double octave, in order to resonate with the more desirable, harmonious notes.During the Islamic golden age, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī (973-1048) is believed to postulated that the speed of sound was much slower than the speed of light.The physical understanding of acoustical processes advanced rapidly during and after the Scientific Revolution.Mainly Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) but also Marin Mersenne (1588–1648), independently, discovered the complete laws of vibrating strings (completing what Pythagoras and Pythagoreans had started 2000 years earlier).Galileo wrote "Waves are produced by the vibrations of a sonorous body, which spread through the air, bringing to the tympanum of the ear a stimulus which the mind interprets as sound", a remarkable statement that points to the beginnings of physiological and psychological acoustics.Experimental measurements of the speed of sound in air were carried out successfully between 1630 and 1680 by a number of investigators, prominently Mersenne.

Meanwhile, Newton (1642–1727) derived the relationship for wave velocity in solids, a cornerstone of physical acoustics (Principia, 1687).-- -- -- Age of Enlightenment and onward  -- -- --
The eighteenth century saw major advances in acoustics as mathematicians applied the new techniques of calculus to elaborate theories of sound wave propagation.In the nineteenth century the major figures of mathematical acoustics were Helmholtz in Germany, who consolidated the field of physiological acoustics, and Lord Rayleigh in England, who combined the previous knowledge with his own copious contributions to the field in his monumental work The Theory of Sound (1877).Also in the 19th century, Wheatstone, Ohm, and Henry developed the analogy between electricity and acoustics.The twentieth century saw a burgeoning of technological applications of the large body of scientific knowledge that was by then in place.The first such application was Sabine’s groundbreaking work in architectural acoustics, and many others followed.Underwater acoustics was used for detecting submarines in the first World War.Sound recording and the telephone played important roles in a global transformation of society.Sound measurement and analysis reached new levels of accuracy and sophistication through the use of electronics and computing.The ultrasonic frequency range enabled wholly new kinds of application in medicine and industry.New kinds of transducers (generators and receivers of acoustic energy) were invented and put to use.-- -- Fundamental concepts of acoustics  -- --

Acoustics is defined by ANSI/ASA S1.1-2013 as "(a) Science of sound, including its production, transmission, and effects, including biological and psychological effects.(b) Those qualities of a room that, together, determine its character with respect to auditory effects."The study of acoustics revolves around the generation, propagation and reception of mechanical waves and vibrations.The steps shown in the above diagram can be found in any acoustical event or process.There are many kinds of cause, both natural and volitional.There are many kinds of transduction process that convert energy from some other form into sonic energy, producing a sound wave.There is one fundamental equation that describes sound wave propagation, the acoustic wave equation, but the phenomena that emerge from it are varied and often complex.The wave carries energy throughout the propagating medium.Eventually this energy is transduced again into other forms, in ways that again may be natural and/or volitionally contrived.The final effect may be purely physical or it may reach far into the biological or volitional domains.The five basic steps are found equally well whether we are talking about an earthquake, a submarine using sonar to locate its foe, or a band playing in a rock concert.The central stage in the acoustical process is wave propagation.This falls within the domain of physical acoustics.

There is also a forum where developers can ask questions to peers or staff.Both official and third-party apps are available for listeners to use.The API requires an API key and offers a variety of data which can be used to create an app.Official 8tracks apps are available for iPhone, Android, Windows 8.x and Mac.In order to comply with copyright laws, developers must record and give the number of plays of each song to 8tracks.-- -- -- Artists  -- -- --
By requesting for a unique artist tag, Artists are able to promote their music on 8tracks with a special account.They are able to create mixes with a combination of their own and others' music, or to post full albums via a content-owner account.By using 8tracks to promote their music, fans have the chance to interact with the artists.Notable artists who use 8tracks to promote their music include: Metric, Bassnectar, Carolina Liar, and B.o.B.Additionally, 8tracks has recently partnered with Feature.fm to allow artists to promote their songs natively inside of 8tracks by playing their songs to listeners who are currently listening to the artist's style of music.-- -- Legality  -- --
8tracks is a legal and functional music-sharing network due to their compulsory license with ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC for the public performance of musical works.This license allows non-interactive webcasters to use any music or recordings that have been released to the public.There are various ways in which 8tracks ensures its compliance with legal restrictions:

8tracks follows specific programming rules that limits the number of songs that may be transmitted from any one album or any recording artist on a given channel or playlist.Negotiations to directly license music from participating independent record labels and artists who see promotional value in Internet radio.8tracks pays a royalty rate in two different ways.They first negotiate with representatives of copyright owners and then establish a pursuant to a proceeding conducted by the three judges on the Copyright Royalty Board.These musical works royalties are paid to ASCAP, BMI, and SECAC.This portion of revenue comprises 3% to 5% of total revenues.Reports to the copyright owners of each song used is transmitted on the service, pursuant to negotiate reporting requirements or requirements adopted by the Copyright Royalty Board.As a result, royalties may be fairly allocated and distributed to individual copyright owners and recording artists.-- -- Partnerships  -- --
8tracks has begun to offer their user-curated playlist platform to brands looking to open channels of communication with potential consumers through "music-centric interactive marketing" campaigns.For instance, apparel store/community Threadless partnered with 8tracks to host a monthly contest in which Threadless' warehouse crew judges playlists and the curator of their favorite mix wins a $50 gift certificate.To promote their new, retro Piiq headphones, Sony ran a contest in conjunction with fashion website Lookbook where users created mixes representative of "A Day in the Life (of You)" and those with the most likes won fashion and/or music-related prizes.Rolling Stone also added an interactive element to the release of its yearly "Playlist Issue" by compiling genre-specific celebrity- and artist-curated playlists that were hosted through the magazine's 8tracks user page and also embedded on the Rolling Stone website.This integrated media approach was significant in that it allowed otherwise heavily copyrighted music to be streamed legally.Notable curators included Tom Petty, Elton John, Art Garfunkel, Coldplay's Chris Martin, and Metallica's Lars Ulrich.Finally, California hotel chain Joie de Vivre and its partners offered a variety of prizes to DJs who published and generated the most likes on mixes driven by the theme of "California road trip" in order to drive brand awareness during the peak summer travel season.8tracks has partnered with Feature.fm to offer artists the ability to play their songs as "sponsored tracks" to people who are listening to playlists of the artist's style of music.-- -- Online radio  -- --
8tracks and other Internet radio sites, such as Pandora, allow users to explore a variety of songs and artists based on their musical preferences.

In fluids, sound propagates primarily as a pressure wave.In solids, mechanical waves can take many forms including longitudinal waves, transverse waves and surface waves.Acoustics looks first at the pressure levels and frequencies in the sound wave and how the wave interacts with the environment.This interaction can be described as either a diffraction, interference or a reflection or a mix of the three.If several media are present, a refraction can also occur.Transduction processes are also of special importance to acoustics.-- -- -- Wave propagation: pressure levels  -- -- --

In fluids such as air and water, sound waves propagate as disturbances in the ambient pressure level.While this disturbance is usually small, it is still noticeable to the human ear.The smallest sound that a person can hear, known as the threshold of hearing, is nine orders of magnitude smaller than the ambient pressure.The loudness of these disturbances is related to the sound pressure level (SPL) which is measured on a logarithmic scale in decibels.-- -- -- Wave propagation: frequency  -- -- --
Physicists and acoustic engineers tend to discuss sound pressure levels in terms of frequencies, partly because this is how our ears interpret sound.What we experience as "higher pitched" or "lower pitched" sounds are pressure vibrations having a higher or lower number of cycles per second.In a common technique of acoustic measurement, acoustic signals are sampled in time, and then presented in more meaningful forms such as octave bands or time frequency plots.Both of these popular methods are used to analyze sound and better understand the acoustic phenomenon.The entire spectrum can be divided into three sections:  audio, ultrasonic, and infrasonic.The audio range falls between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz.This range is important because its frequencies can be detected by the human ear.This range has a number of applications, including speech communication and music.The ultrasonic range refers to the very high frequencies: 20,000 Hz and higher.This range has shorter wavelengths which allow better resolution in imaging technologies.Medical applications such as ultrasonography and elastography rely on the ultrasonic frequency range.On the other end of the spectrum, the lowest frequencies are known as the infrasonic range.These frequencies can be used to study geological phenomena such as earthquakes.Analytic instruments such as the spectrum analyzer facilitate visualization and measurement of acoustic signals and their properties.

21st-century classical music is art music, in the contemporary classical tradition, that has been produced since the year 2000.Some elements of the previous century have been retained, including postmodernism, polystylism and eclecticism, which seek to incorporate elements of all styles of music irrespective of whether these are "classical" or not—these efforts represent a slackening differentiation between the various musical genres.Important influences include rock, pop, jazz and the dance traditions associated with these.The combination of classical music and multimedia is another notable practice in the 21st century; the Internet, alongside its related technology, are important resources in this respect.Attitudes towards female composers are also changing.-- -- Composition in the 21st century  -- --
Like the term 20th-century classical music, "21st-century classical music" is defined entirely by the calendar and does not refer to a historical style period in music—in the sense that Baroque and Romantic do—but rather to all art music produced since the year 2000.Musicologists generally say that we are in the contemporary music period—a term which covers art music written from around 1975 or 1945, depending on the historian's perspective.-- -- -- History  -- -- --
During the 20th century, composers started drawing on an ever wider range of sources for inspiration and developed a wide variety of techniques.Debussy became fascinated by the music of a Vietnamese theatre troupe and a Javanese gamelan ensemble and composers were increasingly influenced by the musics of other cultures.Schoenberg and the Second Viennese School developed the dodecaphonic system and serialism.Varèse, Stockhausen, and Xenakis helped pioneer electronic music.Jazz and the popular music of the West became increasingly important—both as influences on art music and as genres of their own.La Monte Young experimented with performance art; John Cage applied the I Ching to his music; Reich and Glass developed minimalism.Music generally became more and more diverse in style as the century progressed.This trend has continued into the 21st century: in 2009 BBC Music Magazine asked 10 composers, mostly British (John Adams, Julian Anderson, Henri Dutilleux, Brian Ferneyhough, Jonathan Harvey, James MacMillan, Michael Nyman, Roxanna Panufnik, Einojuhani Rautavaara, and John Tavener), to discuss the latest trends in western classical music.The consensus was that no particular style is favoured and that individuality is to be encouraged.The works of each of these composers represent different aspects of the music of this century but these composers all came to the same basic conclusion: music is too diverse to categorise or limit.In his interview with the magazine, Dutilleux argued that "there is only good or bad music, whether serious or popular".The music of the 21st century is mostly post-modernist, drawing on many different styles and open to a great many influences.Yet it is still a struggle to encourage the public to listen to contemporary music; indeed, this is true of Indian Classical Music, too.-- -- -- Musical styles and influence  -- -- --
Post-modernism continues to exert an influence on composers in the 21st century.Styles developed in the 20th century, such as minimalism (Philip Glass, Michael Nyman, Steve Reich), postminimalism (Louis Andriessen, Gavin Bryars, John McGuire, Pauline Oliveros (died 2016), Julia Wolfe), New Complexity (James Dillon, Brian Ferneyhough) and New Simplicity (Wolfgang Rihm) continue to be developed.Polystylism and musical eclecticism are growing trends in the 21st century.They combine elements of diverse musical genres and compositional techniques, often alien to the composers' own culture, into a unified and coherent body of works.Composers have often started their musical career in one discipline and have later migrated to or embraced others, while retaining important elements from the former discipline.In some cases, a composer now labelled "classical" may have started out in another discipline.For example, a specific label for John Zorn's music is difficult to choose: he started out as a performance artist and moved through various genres including jazz, hardcore punk, film music, and classical, and often embraces Jewish musical elements.All of these diverse styles appear in his works.Julian Anderson combines elements from many different musical genres and practices in his works.Elements of modernism, spectral music and electronic music are combined with elements of the folk music of Eastern Europe and the resulting works are often influenced by the modality of Indian ragas.His large-scale Book of Hours for 20 players and live electronics premiered in 2005.

The spectrogram produced by such an instrument is a graphical display of the time varying pressure level and frequency profiles which give a specific acoustic signal its defining character.-- -- -- Transduction in acoustics  -- -- --

A transducer is a device for converting one form of energy into another.In an electroacoustic context, this means converting sound energy into electrical energy (or vice versa).Electroacoustic transducers include loudspeakers, microphones, hydrophones and sonar projectors.These devices convert a sound pressure wave to or from an electric signal.The most widely used transduction principles are electromagnetism, electrostatics and piezoelectricity.The transducers in most common loudspeakers (e.g.woofers and tweeters), are electromagnetic  devices that generate waves using a suspended diaphragm driven by an electromagnetic voice coil, sending off pressure waves.Electret microphones and condenser microphones employ electrostatics—as the sound wave strikes the microphone's diaphragm, it moves and induces a voltage change.The ultrasonic systems used in medical ultrasonography employ piezoelectric transducers.These are made from special ceramics in which mechanical vibrations and electrical fields are interlinked through a property of the material itself.-- -- Acoustician  -- --
An acoustician is an expert in the science of sound.-- -- -- Education  -- -- --
There are many types of acoustician, but they usually have a Bachelor's degree or higher qualification.Some possess a degree in acoustics, while others enter the discipline via studies in fields such as physics or engineering.Much work in acoustics requires a good grounding in Mathematics and science.Many acoustic scientists work in research and development.Some conduct basic research to advance our knowledge of the perception (e.g.hearing, psychoacoustics or neurophysiology) of speech, music and noise.Other acoustic scientists advance understanding of how sound is affected as it moves through environments, e.g.Underwater acoustics, Architectural acoustics or Structural acoustics.Other areas of work are listed under subdisciplines below.Acoustic scientists work in government, university and private industry laboratories.Many go on to work in Acoustical Engineering.Some positions, such as Faculty (academic staff) require a Doctor of Philosophy.

Tansy Davies's music also fuses elements of pop and classical music.Prince and Iannis Xenakis are both major influences.Kati Agócs' work for chorus and orchestra The Debrecen Passion (2015) surrounds settings of poetry by Szilárd Borbély with mystical texts of Medieval Latin, Hungarian, and Georgian origin, as well as a Kabalistic prayer.Composers are influenced from around the world.For example, in 2002, La Monte Young, along with Marian Zazeela, and senior disciple Jung Hee Choi founded the Just Alap Raga Ensemble which performs Indian classical music of the Kirana Gharana and merges the traditions of Western and Hindustani classical music, Young applying his own compositional approach to traditional raga performance, form, and technique.Other composers have also drawn upon diverse cultural and religious influences.For example, John Tavener (died 2013) drew his inspiration from eastern mysticism and the music of the Orthodox Church and James MacMillan is influenced by both traditional Scottish music and his own Roman Catholic faith.In a more abstract manner, religious and mystical associations are also found in the works of Sofia Gubaidulina, a devout member of the Russian Orthodox church.The influence of electronic music, numerology, unusual instrumentation and improvisational techniques are also apparent.Marxist songs serve as basic material for Konrad Boehmer in many works.Roman Turovsky-Savchuk is influenced by his Ukrainian heritage and Baroque music.He composes for the lute, orpharion and torban, and is an advocate of musical historicism and has collaborated with Hans Kockelmans and the New York Bandura Ensemble led by Julian Kytasty.Tan Dun, best known for his scores for the movies Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero, attempts to connect Buddhist, Christian and other cultures in his works.His works often incorporate audiovisual elementsComposers find inspiration from other sources, too.The music of John Luther Adams (an Alaskan environmentalist and no relation to the other John Adams discussed in this article) is informed by nature, especially that of his native Alaska.His Pulitzer Prize-winning symphony Become Ocean was inspired by climate change.Frank's House by Andrew Norman tries to evoke the architecture of Frank Gehry's house in Santa Monica.Péter Eötvös employs a variety of timbres and sound-worlds within his music.Extended techniques such as over-pressure bowings coexist with lyrical folk songs and synthesized sounds.Composers have even created mashups, more commonly found in pop music.Jeremy Sams' The Enchanted Island is one example: he draws from Handel, Vivaldi, Rameau, and other Baroque composers to create a combination of pasticcio and musical collage which also combines the baroque and the modern in its staging and costume.According to A History of Western Music, "it calls into question ideas of authorship and originality, making it a thoroughly postmodern work".The music of Osvaldo Golijov often combines the classical, modern and popular traditions within a single work juxtaposing contrasting styles—an important trend in the music of the 1960s onward.-- -- -- -- Opera  -- -- -- --
John Adams, George Benjamin, Osvaldo Golijov, Cristóbal Halffter, James MacMillan, Einojuhani Rautavaara (died 2016), Kaija Saariaho, Karlheinz Stockhausen (died 2007),  and Judith Weir have all made important contributions in this field:

Licht, Stockhausen's cycle of seven operas, begun in 1977, was completed in 2003 with the opera Sonntag aus Licht.Weir's opera Armida was premiered on television, rather than on stage.Channel 4 commissioned the work in 2005.The libretto, also written by Weir, updates Torquato Tasso's 1581 epic poem, La Gerusalemme liberata, setting it in a modern Middle-East conflict which alludes to but never specifically mentions the Iraq War.Weir's opera calls for props that could not be used practically in an opera house, such as a helicopter.Doctor Atomic by Adams (which covers Robert Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project, and the building of the first atomic bomb).Oppenheimer's aria Batter my heart blends post-minimalist techniques with an expressive vocal line recalling 19th-century opera.In October 2008, just before the premiere, Adams told BBC Radio 3 that he had been blacklisted by the U.S.Homeland Security department and immigration services, probably because of controversy surrounding his 1991 opera The Death of Klinghoffer, which was based on the hijacking of the passenger liner Achille Lauro by the Palestine Liberation Front in 1985 and the hijackers' murder of wheelchair-bound 69-year-old Jewish-American passenger Leon Klinghoffer.Saariaho's L'amour de loin uses her spectralist-influenced orchestral style to tell the story of 12th-century troubadour Jaufré Rudel.In the last tableau of Act IV, the modernist technique of cells based on arrays of semitones and tritones within perfect fifths is applied to the melodic material, while troubadour songs are evoked in the patterns of repeating phrases and the melodic style of short phrases focussed around certain pitches.Thus, 12th- and 20th-century musical ideas are fused in a unique manner.

These subdisciplines are a slightly modified list from the PACS (Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme) coding used by the Acoustical Society of America.-- -- -- Archaeoacoustics  -- -- --

Archaeoacoustics, also known as the archaeology of sound, is one of the only ways to experience the past with senses other than our eyes.Archaeoacoustics is studied by testing the acoustic properties of prehistoric sites, including caves.Iegor Rezkinoff, a sound archaeologist, studies the acoustic properties of caves through natural sounds like humming and whistling.Archaeological theories of acoustics are focused around ritualistic purposes as well as a way of echolocation in the caves.In archaeology, acoustic sounds and rituals directly correlate as specific sounds were meant to bring ritual participants closer to a spiritual awakening.Parallels can also be drawn between cave wall paintings and the acoustic properties of the cave; they are both dynamic.Because archaeoacoustics is a fairly new archaeological subject, acoustic sound is still being tested in these prehistoric sites today.-- -- -- Aeroacoustics  -- -- --

Aeroacoustics is the study of noise generated by air movement, for instance via turbulence, and the movement of sound through the fluid air.This knowledge is applied in acoustical engineering to study how to quieten aircraft.Aeroacoustics is important to understanding how wind musical instruments work.-- -- -- Acoustic signal processing  -- -- --

Acoustic signal processing is the electronic manipulation of acoustic signals.Applications include: active noise control; design for hearing aids or cochlear implants; echo cancellation; music information retrieval, and perceptual coding (e.g.MP3 or Opus).-- -- -- Architectural acoustics  -- -- --

Architectural acoustics (also known as building acoustics) involves the scientific understanding of how to achieve good sound within a building.It typically involves the study of speech intelligibility, speech privacy, music quality, and vibration reduction in the built environment.-- -- -- Bioacoustics  -- -- --

Bioacoustics is the scientific study of the hearing and calls of animal calls, as well as how animals are affected by the acoustic and sounds of their habitat.-- -- -- Electroacoustics  -- -- --

This subdiscipline is concerned with the recording, manipulation and reproduction of audio using electronics.This might include products such as mobile phones, large scale public address systems or virtual reality systems in research laboratories.-- -- -- Environmental noise and soundscapes  -- -- --

Environmental acoustics is concerned with noise and vibration caused by railways,  road traffic, aircraft, industrial equipment and recreational activities.The main aim of these studies is to reduce levels of environmental noise and vibration.Research work now also has a focus on the positive use of sound in urban environments: soundscapes and tranquility.-- -- -- Musical acoustics  -- -- --

Musical acoustics is the study of the physics of acoustic instruments; the audio signal processing used in electronic music; the computer analysis of music and composition, and the perception and cognitive neuroscience of music.-- -- -- Psychoacoustics  -- -- --
Many studies have been conducted to identify the relationship between acoustics and cognition, or more commonly known as psychoacoustics, in which what one hears is a combination of perception and biological aspects.

The Spanish composer Halffter wrote his second and third operas, Lazarus (2008) and Schachnovelle (2013), both for the Kiel Opera House.Golijov's Grammy-award winning Ainadamar (2005) is about the murder in 1936 of Spanish poet Federico García Lorca by the Fascists.The score combines computer music, musique concrète and modernist dissonance with elements from Flamenco music, Latin American popular music and Cuban rhythms.Written on Skin by Benjamin, The Sacrifice by MacMillan and Rasputin by Rautavaara are other representative works.Chamber opera is an important type of opera developed in the mid-twentieth century.They use smaller scale forces than regular operas.Examples from the 21st century include Pauline by Tobin Stokes (libretto by Margaret Atwood), The Corridor by Harrison Birtwistle, El Caballero de la triste figura by Tomás Marco and The Sound of a Voice by Philip Glass.-- -- -- -- Song and choral music  -- -- -- --
Adams' On the Transmigration of Souls (2002) is a choral piece commemorating the victims of the 11 September 2001 attacks (for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2003).Roxanna Panufnik's recent output includes The Song of Names and All Shall be Well.Golijov's La Pasión según San Marcos, Gubaidulina's Johannes-Passion, Tan Dun's Water Passion, and Wolfgang Rihm's Deus Passus were all composed for the Passion 2000 project, through which the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart commemorated the 250th anniversary of the death of J.S.Bach.Golijov, being a Jew and Latin American, offered a different perspective on the Passion: he drew on African-influenced traditions from Cuba and Brazil, flamenco and Baroque music to create a work that enacts the story as a ritual through voices, dance and movement.Henri Dutilleux's last works (died 2013) include Correspondances and Le temps l'horloge, both of which are song cycles.-- -- -- -- Orchestral works  -- -- -- --
Arvo Pärt's Symphony No.4, Los Angeles is the first of his symphonies to be written post-1976 and is the first of his pieces to focus on larger scale, instrumental tintinnabulation.Oliver Knussen's Violin Concerto, Op.30, written for Pinchas Zukerman, premièred in 2003.Jennifer Higdon's blue cathedral, premièred in 2000, is a one-movement orchestral tone-poem and is ranked among the most widely performed works of the early 21st century.It was written in memory of her brother and features flute (her instrument) and clarinet (his instrument) in dialogue in their upper registers.The work evokes Debussy's more accessible form of modernism: parallel triads in strings and brass; changes in pitch set demarcating musical units, such as phrases, and providing a sense of harmonic progression; and Debussy's distinctive orchestral colour.Samuel Adler's compositions for orchestra from this century include: A Bridge to Understanding (2008), All Nature Plays (2009), Drifting on Winds and Currents (2010), and In the Spirit of Bach (2014).Jonathan Harvey's Body Mandala (2006) and Speakings (2008), Anna Clyne's Night Ferry, Elliott Carter's Three Illusions for Orchestra, Christopher Theofanidis' Rainbow Body, Peter Maxwell Davies's Eighth (2001), Ninth (2012), and Tenth (2013) Symphonies, and Per Nørgård's Seventh (2006) and Eighth (2011) Symphonies are just some of the other important orchestral works produced this century.-- -- -- -- Chamber and instrumental music  -- -- -- --
Elliott Carter (died 2012) has written a large body of music for chamber groups and soloist since 2000.These include Tintinnabulation for percussion sextet, Double Trio for trumpet, trombone, percussion, piano, violin and cello, a string trio, Hiyoku for two clarinets, as well as several new pieces in his Retracing and Figment series for soloists and Two Thoughts about the Piano.His Caténaires for solo piano (2006) evokes both the texture of the finale of Chopin's B♭ minor Sonata and 20th-century serialism.Stockhausen's last major work, the unfinished cycle of twenty-four compositions collectively titled Klang, is predominantly made up of chamber-music pieces.Notable string quartets composed since 2000 include: 

the quartet by Hanspeter Kyburz
the Sixth (2002), Seventh ("Espacio de silencio", 2007), Eighth ("Ausencias", 2013), and Ninth ("In memoriam Miguel de Cervantes", 2016) Quartets by Cristóbal Halffter
two numbered quartets—the Fifth (2006) and Sixth (2009)—and Dum transisset I–IV (2007), Exordium (2008), and Silentium (2014) by Brian Ferneyhough
the series of ten Naxos Quartets (2001–07) by Peter Maxwell Davies.At his death in 2016, Davies also left an unfinished final String Quartet, Op.338, of which only the first movement was completed.The German composer Wolfgang Rihm extended his list of string quartets, first with the Twelfth Quartet (2001), the brief Fetzen 2 (2002), and a Quartettstudie (2003–04), then with a revised version of String Quartet No.11 (2010) and the Thirteenth Quartet (2011), as well as another short work, In Verbundenheit (2014).Austrian Georg Friedrich Haas has written a Third ("In iij.Noct.", 2003) and Fourth String Quartet (2003), and the Hungarian composer György Kurtág has also extended his series of (unnumbered) works for this medium, with Six Moments Musicaux (1999–2005), Hommage à Jacob Obrecht (2004–2005), and—in collaboration with György Kurtág junior—Zwiegespräch for string quartet and electronics (1999–2006).-- -- -- -- Electronic music  -- -- -- --
Electronic, electroacoustic, and computer music, pioneered in the 20th century, continue to develop in the 21st century.One of the major figures in the early development of electronic music, Karlheinz Stockhausen, composed his last electronic works—Cosmic Pulses and eight further pieces derived from it—as hours 13 to 21 of his Klang cycle (2005–2007).Mario Davidovsky has extended his series Synchronisms, which in live performance incorporate both acoustic instruments and electroacoustic sounds played from a tape.Other composers including Mason Bates, Jean-Claude Éloy, Rolf Gehlhaar, Jon Hassell, York Höller, Hanspeter Kyburz, Mesías Maiguashca, Philippe Manoury, and Gérard Pape are active is this field.

The information intercepted by the passage of sound waves through the ear is understood and interpreted through the brain, emphasizing the connection between the mind and acoustics.Psychological changes have been seen as brain waves slow down or speed up as a result of varying auditory stimulus which can in turn affect the way one thinks, feels, or even behaves.This correlation can be viewed in normal, everyday situations in which listening to an upbeat or uptempo song can cause one's foot to start tapping or a slower song can leave one feeling calm and serene.In a deeper biological look at the phenomenon of psychoacoustics, it was discovered that the central nervous system is activated by basic acoustical characteristics of music.By observing how the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spine, is influenced by acoustics, the pathway in which acoustic affects the mind, and essentially the body, is evident.-- -- -- Speech  -- -- --

Acousticians study the production, processing and perception of speech.Speech recognition and Speech synthesis are two important areas of speech processing using computers.The subject also overlaps with the disciplines of physics, physiology, psychology, and linguistics.-- -- -- Ultrasonics  -- -- --

Ultrasonics deals with sounds at frequencies too high to be heard by humans.Specialisms include medical ultrasonics (including medical ultrasonography), sonochemistry, material characterisation and underwater acoustics (Sonar).-- -- -- Underwater acoustics  -- -- --

An academic degree is a qualification awarded to students upon successful completion of a course of study in higher education, usually at a college or university.These institutions commonly offer degrees at various levels, usually including bachelor's, master’s and doctorates, often alongside other academic certificates and professional degrees.The most common undergraduate degree is the bachelor's degree, although in some countries there are lower level higher education qualifications that are also titled degrees (e.g.associate degrees and foundation degrees).-- -- History  -- --

The doctorate (Latin: doceo “I teach”) appeared in medieval Europe as a license to teach (Latin: licentia docendi) at a medieval university.Its roots can be traced to the early church when the term "doctor" referred to the Apostles, church fathers and other Christian authorities who taught and interpreted the Bible.The right to grant a licentia docendi was originally reserved to the church which required the applicant to pass a test, to take oath of allegiance and pay a fee.The Third Council of the Lateran of 1179 guaranteed the access – now largely free of charge – of all able applicants, who were, however, still tested for aptitude by the ecclesiastic scholastic.This right remained a bone of contention between the church authorities and the slowly emancipating universities, but was granted by the Pope to the University of Paris in 1231 where it became a universal license to teach (licentia ubique docendi).However, while the licentia continued to hold a higher prestige than the bachelor's degree (Baccalaureus), it was ultimately reduced to an intermediate step to the Magister and doctorate, both of which now became the exclusive qualification for teaching.At the University, doctoral training was a form of apprenticeship to a guild.The traditional term of study before new teachers were admitted to the guild of "Master of Arts", seven years, was the same as the term of apprenticeship for other occupations.Originally the terms "master" and "doctor" were synonymous, but over time the doctorate came to be regarded as a higher qualification than the master degree.Today the terms "master", "Doctor" (from the Latin – meaning literally: "teacher") and "Professor" signify different levels of academic achievement, but in the Medieval university they were equivalent terms, the use of them in the degree name being a matter of custom at a university.(Most universities conferred the Master of Arts, although the highest degree was often termed Master of Theology/Divinity or Doctor of Theology/Divinity depending on the place).The earliest doctoral degrees (theology – Divinitatis Doctor (D.D.), law – Legum Doctor (LL.D., later D.C.L.)and medicine – Medicinæ Doctor (M.D., D.M.))reflected the historical separation of all higher University study into these three fields.Over time, the D.D.has gradually become less common outside theology and is now mostly used for honorary degrees, with the title "Doctor of Theology" being used more often for earned degrees.Studies outside theology, law and medicine were then called "philosophy", due to the Renaissance conviction that real knowledge could be derived from empirical observation.The degree title of Doctor of Philosophy is a much later time and was not introduced in England before 1900.Studies in what once was called philosophy are now classified as sciences and humanities.The University of Bologna in Italy, regarded as the oldest university in Europe, was the first institution to confer the degree of Doctor in Civil Law in the late 12th century; it also conferred similar degrees in other subjects, including medicine.The University of Paris used the term "master" for its graduates, a practice adopted by the English universities of Oxford and Cambridge, as well as the ancient Scottish universities of St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh.-- -- -- Emergence of the bachelor's degree  -- -- --
In the medieval European universities, candidates who had completed three or four years of study in the prescribed texts of the trivium (grammar, rhetoric and logic) and the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music), together known as the Liberal Arts and who had successfully passed examinations held by their master, would be admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Arts, from the Latin baccalaureus, a term previously used of a squire (i.e., apprentice) to a knight.Further study and in particular successful participation in and then moderating of disputations would earn one the Master of Arts degree, from the Latin magister, "master" (typically indicating a teacher), entitling one to teach these subjects.Masters of Arts were eligible to enter study under the "higher faculties" of Law, Medicine or Theology and earn first a bachelor's and then master or doctor's degrees in these subjects.Thus a degree was only a step on the way to becoming a fully qualified master – hence the English word "graduate", which is based on the Latin gradus ("step").-- -- -- The evolution of the terminology of degrees  -- -- --
The naming of degrees eventually became linked with the subjects studied.Scholars in the faculties of arts or grammar became known as "master", but those in theology, medicine and law were known as "doctor".

As study in the arts or in grammar was a necessary prerequisite to study in subjects such as theology, medicine and law, the degree of doctor assumed a higher status than the master degree.This led to the modern hierarchy in which the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), which in its present form as a degree based on research and dissertation is a development from 18th- and 19th-century German universities, is a more advanced degree than the Master of Arts (M.A.).The practice of using the term doctor for PhDs developed within German universities and spread across the academic world.The French terminology is tied closely to the original meanings of the terms.The baccalauréat (cf."bachelor") is conferred upon French students who have successfully completed their secondary education and admits the student to university.When students graduate from university, they are awarded licence, much as the medieval teaching guilds would have done and they are qualified to teach in secondary schools or proceed to higher-level studies.Spain had a similar structure: the term "Bachiller" was used for those who finished the secondary or high-school level education, known as "Bachillerato".The standard Spanish university 5-years degree was "Licenciado", (although there were a few 3-years associate degrees called "diplomaturas", from where the "diplomados" could move to study a related licenciatura).The highest level was "Doctor".-- -- -- Degrees awarded by institutions other than universities  -- -- --
In the past, degrees have also been directly issued by authority of the monarch or by a bishop, rather than any educational institution.This practice has mostly died out.In Great Britain, Lambeth Degrees are still awarded by the Archbishop of Canterbury.The Archbishop of Canterbury's right to grant degrees is derived from Peter's Pence Act of 1533 which empowered the Archbishop to grant dispensations previously granted by the Pope.Among educational institutions, St David's College, Lampeter was granted limited degree awarding powers by royal charter in the nineteenth century, despite not being a university.University College North Staffordshire was also granted degree awarding powers on its foundation in 1949, despite not becoming a university (as the University of Keele) until 1962.Following the Education Reform Act 1988, many educational institutions other than universities have been granted degree awarding powers, including higher education colleges and colleges of the University of London (many of which are now effectively universities in their own right).-- -- -- Academic dress  -- -- --

In most countries, gaining an academic degree entitles the holder to assume distinctive academic dress particular to the awarding institution, identifying the status of the individual wearing them.-- -- Laws on granting and use of degrees  -- --

In many countries degrees may only be awarded by institutions authorised to do so by the national or regional government.Frequently governments will also regulate the use of university in names of businesses.This approach is followed, for example, by Australia and the United Kingdom.The use of fake degrees by individuals, either obtained from a bogus institution or simply invented, is often covered by fraud laws.-- -- Indicating earned degrees  -- --
Depending on culture and the degree earned, degrees may be indicated by a pre-nominal title, post-nominal letters, a choice of either or not indicated at all.In countries influenced by the UK, post-nominal letters are the norm, with only doctorates granting a title, while titles are the norm in many northern European countries.Depending on the culture and the purpose of the listing, only the highest degree, a selection of degrees or all degrees might be listed.The awarding institution may also be shown and it might be specified if a degree was at honours level, particularly where the honours degree is a separate qualification from the ordinary bachelor's degree.For member institutions of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, there is a standard list of abbreviations for university names given in the Commonwealth Universities Yearbook, but in practice many variations are used and the Yearbook notes that the abbreviations used may not match those used by the universities concerned.For some British universities it is traditional to use Latin abbreviations, notably 'Oxon' and 'Cantab' for the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge respectively, in spite of these having been superseded by English 'Oxf' and 'Camb' in official university usage, particularly in order to distinguish the Oxbridge MA from an earned MA.Other Latin abbreviations commonly used include 'Cantuar' for Lambeth degrees (awarded by the Archbishop of Canterbury), 'Dunelm' for Durham University, 'Ebor' for the University of York and 'Exon' for the University of Exeter.The Ancient universities of Scotland and the University of London have abbreviations that are the same in English and Latin.(See Universities in the United Kingdom § Post-nominal abbreviations for a more complete list and discussion of abbreviations for British universities.)Confusion can result from universities sharing similar names, e.g.

Acrobatics (from Ancient Greek ἀκροβατέω, akrobateo, "walk on tiptoe, strut") is the performance of extraordinary human feats of balance, agility, and motor coordination.It can be found in many of the performing arts, sporting events, and martial arts.Acrobatics is most often associated with activities that make extensive use of gymnastic elements, such as acro dance, circus, and gymnastics, but many other athletic activities — such as ballet and diving — may also employ acrobatics.Although acrobatics is most commonly associated with human body performance, it may also apply to other types of performance, such as aerobatics.-- -- History  -- --

Acrobatic traditions are found in many cultures, and there is evidence that the earliest such traditions occurred thousands of years ago.For example, Minoan art from c. 2000 BC contains depictions of acrobatic feats on the backs of bulls.Ancient Greeks practiced acrobatics, and the noble court displays of the European Middle Ages would often include acrobatic performances that included juggling.In China, acrobatics have been a part of the culture since the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220).Acrobatics were part of village harvest festivals.During the Tang Dynasty, acrobatics saw much the same sort of development as European acrobatics saw during the Middle Ages, with court displays during the 7th through 10th century dominating the practice.Acrobatics continues to be an important part of modern Chinese variety art.Though the term initially applied to tightrope walking, in the 19th century, a form of performance art including circus acts began to use the term as well.In the late 19th century, tumbling and other acrobatic and gymnastic activities became competitive sport in Europe.Acrobatics has often served as a subject for fine art.Examples of this are paintings such as Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg) by Impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir, which depicts two German acrobatic sisters, Pablo Picasso's 1905 Acrobat and Young Harlequin, and Acrobats in a Paris suburb by Viktor Vasnetsov.-- -- Types  -- --

An online degree is an academic degree (usually a college degree, but sometimes the term includes high school diplomas and non-degree certificate programs) that can be earned primarily or entirely on a distance learning basis through the use of an Internet-connected computer, rather than attending college in a traditional campus setting.Improvements in technology, the increasing use of the Internet worldwide and the need for people to have flexible school schedules that enable them to work while attending school have led to a proliferation of online colleges that award associate's, bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees.-- -- Degree systems by regions  -- --

Aesthetics of music () is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of art, beauty and taste in music, and with the creation or appreciation of beauty in music.In the pre-modern tradition, the aesthetics of music or musical aesthetics explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization.In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (plaisir and jouissance) of music.The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to Baumgarten in the 18th century, followed by Kant.Through their writing, the ancient term aesthetics, meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation.In recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment.For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.Aesthetics is a sub-discipline of philosophy.In the 20th century, important contributions to the aesthetics of music were made by Peter Kivy, Jerrold Levinson, Roger Scruton, and Stephen Davies.However, many musicians, music critics, and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music.In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between Eduard Hanslick, a music critic and musicologist, and composer Richard Wagner regarding whether instrumental music could communicate emotions to the listener.Wagner and his disciples argued that instrumental music could communicate emotions and images; composers who held this belief wrote instrumental tone poems, which attempted to tell a story or depict a landscape using instrumental music.Hanslick and his partisans asserted that instrumental music is simply patterns of sound that do not communicate any emotions or images.Since ancient times, it has been thought that music has the ability to affect our emotions, intellect, and psychology; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions.The Ancient Greek philosopher Plato suggests in The Republic that music has a direct effect on the soul.Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime, music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include lyricism, harmony, hypnotism, emotiveness, temporal dynamics, resonance, playfulness, and color (see also musical development).-- -- 18th century aesthetics of music  -- --
In the 18th century, music was considered so far outside the realm of aesthetic theory (then conceived of in visual terms) that music was barely mentioned in William Hogarth's treatise The Analysis of Beauty.He considered dance beautiful (closing the treatise with a discussion of the minuet), but treated music important only insofar as it could provide the proper accompaniment for the dancers.However, by the end of the century, people began to distinguish the topic of music and its own beauty from music as part of a mixed media, as in opera and dance.Immanuel Kant, whose Critique of Judgment is generally considered the most important and influential work on aesthetics in the 18th century, argued that instrumental music is beautiful but ultimately trivial.Compared to the other fine arts, it does not engage the understanding sufficiently, and it lacks moral purpose.To display the combination of genius and taste that combines ideas and beauty, Kant thought that music must be combined with words, as in song and opera.-- -- 19th century aesthetics of music  -- --
In the 19th century, the era of romanticism in music, some composers and critics argued that music should and could express ideas, images, emotions, or even a whole literary plot.Challenging Kant's reservations about instrumental music, in 1813 E. T. A. Hoffmann argued that music was fundamentally the art of instrumental composition.Five years later, Arthur Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation argued that instrumental music is the greatest art, because it is uniquely capable of representing the metaphysical organization of reality.He felt that because music neither represents the phenomenal world, nor makes statements about it, it bypasses both the pictorial and the verbal.He believed that music was much closer to the true nature of all things than any other art form.This idea would explain why, when the appropriate music is set to any scene, action or event is played, it seems to reveal its innermost meaning, appearing to be the most accurate and distinct commentary of it.Although the Romantic movement accepted the thesis that instrumental music has representational capacities, most did not support Schopenhauer's linking of music and metaphysics.The mainstream consensus endorsed music's capacity to represent particular emotions and situations.

Since the Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education in the European Region in 1997 and the Bologna declaration in 1999, higher education systems in Europe are being harmonised through the Bologna process, based on a three-cycle hierarchy of degrees: Bachelor's/Licence –  Master's – Doctorate, with the later addition of a "short cycle (within the first cycle)" to cover sub-bachelor's qualifications.This system is gradually replacing the two-stage system previously used in some countries and is combined with other elements such as the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) and the use of Diploma Supplements to make comparisons between qualifications easier.The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) was formally established in 2010 and as of September 2016 has 50 members.Implementation of the various elements of the EHEA varies.Twenty-four countries have fully implemented a national qualifications framework and a further ten have a framework but have not yet certified it against the overarching framework; in 38 countries ECTS credits are used for all higher education programmes; 31 countries have fully implemented diploma supplements; and only 11 countries have included all the major points of the Lisbon Recognition Convention in national legislation.From 2008, the European Union has been developing the European Qualifications Framework (EQF).This is an eight-level framework designed to allow cross-referencing of the various national qualifications frameworks.While it is not specific to higher education, the top four levels (5–8) correspond to the short cycle, first cycle, second cycle and third cycle of the EHEA.-- -- -- -- Austria  -- -- -- --
In Austria, there are currently two parallel systems of academic degrees:

the traditional two-cycle system of Magister/Diplom followed by the Doctorate and
the three-cycle system of Bachelor, Master and Doctorate as defined by the Bologna process.With a few exceptions, the two-cycle degree system will be phased out by 2010.Some of the established degree naming has, however, been preserved, allowing universities to award the "Diplom-Ingenieur" (and for a while also the "Magister") to graduates of the new-style Master programmes.-- -- -- -- Czech Republic  -- -- -- --
The Czech Republic implemented Bologna process so there are basically three degrees: Bachelor (3 years), Master (2 years after Bachelor) and Doctor (3 years after Master).There are also voluntary academic titles called "small doctorates" (e. g. RNDr.for natural sciences, PhDr.for philosophy, JUDr.for law etc.)achieved after rigorosum exam.Medical students don't get bachelor's or master's degrees, instead they study six years and after obligatory rigorous exam they get title MUDr.(equivalent to MD degree) or MDDr.for dentists or MVDr.for veterinary physicians.They can also get "big doctorate" (Ph.D.) after another three or (more often) four years of studies.Bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and small doctorates in the form of shortcuts (Bc., Mgr., Ing., ...) are listed before name of person, Doctor degree (Ph.D.) is listed after name (e. g. MUDr.Jan Novák, Ph.D.).There are more degrees that used to be awarded, but you can still encounter them.

In 1832, composer Robert Schumann stated that his piano work Papillons was "intended as a musical representation" of the final scene of a novel by Jean Paul, Flegeljahre.The thesis that the value of music is related to its representational function was vigorously countered by the formalism of Eduard Hanslick, setting off the "War of the Romantics."This fight divided the aesthetics into two competing groups: On one side are formalists (e.g., Hanslick), who emphasize that the rewards of music are found in appreciation of musical form or design, while on the other side are the anti-formalists, such as Richard Wagner, who regarded musical form as a means to other artistic ends.-- -- 20th century aesthetics of music  -- --
A group of modernist writers in the early 20th century (including the poet Ezra Pound) believed that music was essentially pure because it didn't represent anything, or make reference to anything beyond itself.In a sense, they wanted to bring poetry closer to Hanslick's ideas about the autonomous, self-sufficient character of music.(Bucknell 2002) Dissenters from this view notably included Albert Schweitzer, who argued against the alleged 'purity' of music in a classic work on Bach.Far from being a new debate, this disagreement between modernists and their critics was a direct continuation of the 19th-century debate about the autonomy of music.Among 20th-century composers, Igor Stravinsky is the most prominent composer to defend the modernist idea of musical autonomy.When a composer creates music, Stravinsky claims, the only relevant thing "is his apprehension of the contour of the form, for the form is everything.He can say nothing whatever about meanings" (Stravinsky 1962, p. 115).Although listeners often look for meanings in music, Stravinsky warned that these are distractions from the musical experience.The most distinctive development in the aesthetics of music in the 20th century was that attention was directed at the distinction between 'higher' and 'lower' music, now understood to align with the distinction between art music and popular music, respectively.Theodor Adorno suggested that culture industries churn out a debased mass of unsophisticated, sentimental products that have replaced more 'difficult' and critical art forms that might lead people to actually question social life.False needs are cultivated in people by the culture industries.These needs can be both created and satisfied by the capitalist system, and can replace people's 'true' needs: freedom, full expression of human potential and creativity, and genuine creative happiness.Thus, those trapped in the false notions of beauty according to a capitalist mode of thinking can only hear beauty in dishonest terms (citation necessary).Beginning with Peter Kivy's work in the 1970s, analytic philosophy has contributed extensively to the aesthetics of music.Analytic philosophy pays very little attention to the topic of musical beauty.Instead, Kivy inspired extensive debate about the nature of emotional expressiveness in music.He also contributed to the debate over the nature of authentic performances of older music arguing that much of the debate was incoherent because it failed to distinguish among four distinct standards of authentic performance of music (1995).-- -- 21st century aesthetics of music  -- --
In the 21st century, philosophers such as Nick Zangwill have extended the study of aesthetics in music as studied in the 20th century by scholars such as Jerrold Levinson and Peter Kivy.In his 2014 book on the aesthetics of music titled Music and Aesthetic Reality: Formalism and the Limits of Description, Zangwill introduces his realist position by stating, "By 'realism' about musical experience, I mean a view that foregrounds the aesthetic properties of music and our experience of these properties: Musical experience is an awaremeness of an array of sounds and out the sound structure and its aesthetic properties.This is the content of musical experience."Contemporary music in the 20th and 21st century has had both supporters and detractors.Theodor Adorno in the 20th century was a critic of much popular music.Others in the 21st century, such as Eugene W. Holland, have constructively proposed jazz improvisation as a socio-economic model, and Edward W. Sarath has constructively proposed jazz as a useful paradigm for understanding education and society.-- -- -- Constructive reception  -- -- --

Simon Frith (2004, p. 17-9) argues that, "'bad music' is a necessary concept for musical pleasure, for musical aesthetics."He distinguishes two common kinds of bad music: the Worst Records Ever Made type, which include "Tracks which are clearly incompetent musically; made by singers who can't sing, players who can't play, producers who can't produce," and "Tracks involving genre confusion.

Before the adaptation to international standards, the lowest degree that would normally be studied at universities in Denmark was equivalent to a master's degree (kandidatgrad).Officially, bachelor's degrees was always obtained after 3 years' university studies.Various medium-length (2–4 years) professional degrees have been adapted so they now have status as professional bachelor's degrees of varying length and opposed to academic bachelor's degrees they are considered to be "applied" degrees.A professional bachelor's degree is 180 or 210 or 240 ECTS-points.The academic degrees available at universities are:
bachelor i <field of study> (bachelor's degree  -- 180 ECTS-points)

 -- -- -- -- Finland  -- -- -- --
Historically, the Finnish higher education system is derived from the German system.The current system of higher education comprises two types of higher education institutions, the universities and the polytechnics, many of whom refer to themselves as Universities of Applied Sciences (UAS) With the exception of few fields such as Medicine and Dentistry, the Finnish system of Higher education degrees is in compliance with the Bologna process.Universities award bachelor's degrees (kandidaatti / kandidat), Master's degrees (maisteri / magister) and doctoral degrees (lisensiaatin tutkinto / licentiat examen and tohtorin tutkinto / doktorexamen).In most fields the system of doctoral degrees is two-tier, the degree of Licentiate is an independent academic degree but completing the degree of Doctor does not require completion of a Licentiate degree.The Polytechnics (Universities of Applied Sciences) have the right to award bachelor's and master's degrees, the degree titles of are distinct from the titles used for university degrees.In general, students who are admitted to bachelor studies at a university have the right to continue to studies at master level.At polytechnics, the right to continue to master-level studies has to be applied for separately and there is also a work experience requirement.The majority of master's degree holders have graduated from university.The degrees awarded by the universities and polytechnics are at par by law, but the content and orientation of studies is different.A master's degree obtained at a polytechnic gives the same academic right to continue studies at Doctoral level as a master's degree obtained at a university.-- -- -- -- France  -- -- -- --
The French national education system makes a distinction between a diplôme national ("national degree") and diplôme universitaire ("university degree").The former, which are considered higher status, are controlled by the state and issued by universities on behalf of the responsible ministry; the latter are controlled and granted by the universities themselves.Additionally, private providers may be recognised by the state and then, after five years of recognition, have their degrees validated by the state, the validation having to be renewed every six years.Historically, academic degrees were orientated towards research and the vocational education system awarded only diplomas.Since the implementation of the Bologna Process in France, things are going towards a simplification: schools continue to deliver their own diplomas, but the State recognition and degree awarding is far more ranged than before.Diploma courses such as the Technological University Diploma (diplôme universitaire de technologie; DUT) and the Technologist's Certificate (brevet de technician supérieur; BTS) are now recognised as "short cycle" qualifications worth 120 ECTS credits, allowing progression from these to academic qualifications.Nonetheless, there are diplomas in France with no degree recognition, e.g.specific diplomas designed by various institutions with no recognition from the Ministry of Education, such as the mastère spécialisé or the Sciences Po Bachelor.The recognised degrees fall in three levels, following the Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area.These are the licence (first cycle), master (second cycle) and doctorat (third cycle).All licence degrees are 3 years (180 ECTS credits) in length and all master's degrees are 2 years (120 ECTS credits) in length.There are also 5 year (300 ECTS credits) engineer's degrees, which are master's degree.In addition to the doctorate, which is always a research degree, the Diplôme d'Etat de docteur en médicine and the Diplôme d'Etat de docteur vétérinaire are also considered third cycle qualifications.-- -- -- -- Germany  -- -- -- --
Traditionally in Germany, students graduated after four to six years either with a Magister degree in Social Sciences, Humanities, Linguistics and the Arts or with a Diplom degree in Natural Sciences, Economics, Business Administration, Political Science, Sociology, Theology and Engineering.Those degrees were the first and at the same time highest non-PhD/Doctorate-title in many disciplines before its gradual replacement by other Anglo-Saxon-inspired master's and bachelor's degrees under the Bologna process.

The most common examples are actors or TV stars recording in the latest style."Another type of "bad music" is "rock critical lists," such as "Tracks that feature sound gimmicks that have outlived their charm or novelty" and "Tracks that depend on false sentiment [...], that feature an excess of feeling molded into a radio-friendly pop song."Frith gives three common qualities attributed to bad music: inauthentic, [in] bad taste (see also: kitsch), and stupid.He argues that "The marking off of some tracks and genres and artists as 'bad' is a necessary part of popular music pleasure; it is a way we establish our place in various music worlds.And 'bad' is a key word here because it suggests that aesthetic and ethical judgements are tied together here: not to like a record is not just a matter of taste; it is also a matter of argument, and argument that matters" (p. 28).Frith's analysis of popular music is based in sociology.Theodor Adorno was a prominent philosopher who wrote on the aesthetics of popular music.A Marxist, Adorno was extremely hostile to popular music.His theory was largely formulated in response to the growing popularity of American music in Europe between World War I and World War II.As a result, Adorno often uses "jazz" as his example of what he believed was wrong with popular music; however, for Adorno this term included everyone from Louis Armstrong to Bing Crosby.He attacked popular music claiming that it is simplistic and repetitive, and encourages a fascist mindset (1973, p. 126).Besides Adorno, Theodore Gracyk provides the most extensive philosophical analysis of popular music.He argues that conceptual categories and distinctions developed in response to art music are systematically misleading when applied to popular music (1996).At the same time, the social and political dimensions of popular music do not deprive it of aesthetic value (2007).In 2007 musicologist and journalist Craig Schuftan published The Culture Club, a book drawing links between modernism art movements and popular music of today and that of past decades and even centuries.His story involves drawing lines between art, or high culture, and pop, or low culture.A more scholarly study of the same topic, Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde, was published five years earlier by philosopher Bernard Gendron.-- -- See also  -- --

The Magister and Diplom awarded by universities, both of which require a final thesis, are considered equivalent to a master's degree, although the Diplom awarded by a Fachhochschule (university of applied sciences) is at bachelor's degree level.A special kind of examination is the Staatsexamen (State Examination).It is not an academic degree but a government licensing examination that future doctors, dentists, teachers, lawyers (solicitors), judges, public prosecutors, patent attorneys and pharmacists have to pass in order to be eligible to work in their profession.Students usually study at university for three to six year, depending on the field, before they take the first Staatsexamen.While this is normally at master's level, a few courses (e.g.primary and lower secondary level teaching), which have a standard study period of three years, are assigned to bachelor's level.After the first Staatsexamen, teachers and lawyers go through a form of pupillage, the Vorbereitungsdienst, for two years, before they are able to take the second Staatsexamen, which tests their practical abilities in their jobs.At some institutions pharmacists and jurists can choose whether to be awarded the first Staatsexamen or a master's degree (or formerly the Diplom).Since 1999, the traditional degrees have been replaced by bachelor's (Bachelor) and master's (Master) degrees as part of the Bologna process.The main reasons for this change are to make degrees internationally comparable and to introduce degrees to the German system which take less time to complete (German students typically took five years or more to earn a Magister or Diplom).Some universities were initially resistant to this change, considering it a displacement of a venerable tradition for the pure sake of globalization.However, universities had to fulfill the new standard by the end of 2007.Enrollment into Diplom and Magister programs is no longer possible.However, programs leading to Staatsexamen did usually not make the transition to Bologna degrees.Doctorates are issued with various designations, depending on the faculty: e.g., Doktor der Naturwissenschaften (Doctor of Natural Science); Doktor der Rechtswissenschaften (Doctor of Law); Doktor der Medizin (Doctor of Medicine); Doktor der Philosophie (Doctor of Philosophy), to name just a few.Multiple doctorates and honorary doctorates are often listed and even used in forms of address in German-speaking countries.A Diplom, Magister, Master's or Staatsexamen student can proceed to a doctorate.Well qualified bachelor's graduates can also enrol directly into PhD programs after a procedure to determine their aptitude administered by the admitting university.The doctoral degree (e.g., Dr. rer.nat., Dr. phil.and others) is the highest academic degree in Germany and generally a research degree.The degree Dr. med.for medical doctors has to be viewed differently; medical students usually write their doctoral theses right after they have completed studies, without any previous conducted scientific research, just as students in other disciplines write a Diplom, Magister or Master's thesis.Higher doctorates, such as the D.Sc.degree in the UK, are not present in the German system.However, sometimes incorrectly regarded as a degree, the Habilitation is a higher academic qualification in Germany, Austria and Switzerland that allows further teaching and research endorsement after a doctorate.It is earned by writing a second thesis (the Habilitationsschrift) or presenting a portfolio of first-author publications in an advanced topic.The exact requirements for satisfying a Habilitation depend on individual universities.The "habil.", as it is abbreviated to represent that a habilitation has been awarded after the doctorate, was traditionally the conventional qualification for serving at least as a Privatdozent (e.g."PD Dr.

Ireland operates under a National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).The school leaving qualification attained by students is called the Leaving Certificate.It is considered Level 4-5 on the framework.This qualification is the traditional route of entry into third level education.There are also Level 5 qualifications in certain vocational subjects (e.g.Level 5 Certificate in Restaurant Operations) awarded by the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC).Advanced Certificates at level 6 are also awarded by FETAC.The Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) award the following:
A higher certificate at Level 6;
An ordinary bachelor's degree at Level 7;
An honours bachelor's degree or higher diploma at Level 8;
A master's degree or postgraduate diploma at Level 9;
A doctoral degree or higher doctorate at level 10.These are completed in institutes of technology or universities.-- -- -- -- Italy  -- -- -- --

In Italy access to university is possible after gaining the Diploma di Maturità at 19 years of age, following 5 years of study in a specific high school focused on certain subjects (e.g.liceo classico focused on classical subjects, including philosophy, ancient Greek and Latin; liceo scientifico focused on scientific subjects such as Maths, Chemistry, Biology and Physics but also including philosophy, ancient Latin and Italian Literature; liceo linguistico focused on Foreign Languages and Literature; istituto tecnico focused on practical and theoretical subjects such as Mechanics, Aerospace, Shipbuilding, Electronics, Computer science, Telecommunications, Chemistry, Biology, Fashion industry, Food industry, Building technology, Law and Economy).After gaining the diploma one can enter university and enrol in any curriculum (e.g.physics, medicine, chemistry, engineering, architecture): all high school diplomas allow access to any university curriculum, although most universities have pre-admission tests.In 2011, Italy introduced a qualifications framework, known as the Quadro dei Titoli Italiani (QTI), tied to the three cycles of the Bologna Process.This tied together in a three-level system both the new qualifications introduced as part of the Bologna process and the older, pre-Bologna qualifications and covers qualifications from university institutions and higher education institutions for fine arts, music and dance (AFAM institutions).In addition to academic degrees, many professional qualifications are tied to the QTI at the different levels.The first level, tied to the first cycle of the Bologna Process, covers the laurea (bachelor's degree) in universities and the Diploma accademico di primo livello in AFAM institutions.The older qualifications mapped to this level are the Diploma universitario and the Diploma di scuole dirette a fini speciali (SDAFS) from universities and the Diploma di Conservatorio, Diploma di Istituto Musicale Pareggiato, Diploma dell'Accademia di Belle Arti, Diploma dell'Istituto Superiore delle Industrie Artistiche (ISIA), Diploma dell'Accademia Nazionale di Danza and Diploma dell'Accademia Nazionale di Arte Drammatica from AFAM institutions.The laurea is obtained after three years of study (180 ECTS credits) and gives the academic title of dottore; the older university qualifications at this level took two to three years, with three year courses granting the title of dottore.The second level, tied to the second cycle of the Bologna Process, covers the Laurea magistrale and the laurea specialistica in university institutions and the Diploma accademico di secondo livello in AFAM institutions.The old Diploma di laurea is mapped to this level.The Laurea magistrale and the laurea specialistica are obtained after two further years of study (120 ECTS credits) and give the academic title of dottore magistrale.The old Diploma di laurea took four to six years but was accessed directly from school, with a possible reduction by one year for those with a related diploma and also granted the title of dottore magistrale.The third level, tied to the third cycle of the Bologna Process, covers the Dottorato di ricerca in university institutions and the Diploma accademico di formazione alla ricerca in AFAM institutions.The old Dottorato di ricerca and Diploma di specializzazione are tied to this level.The Dottorato di ricerca, under both new and old systems, takes a minimum of three years after the laurea magistralie/specialistica and gives the academic titles of Dottore di Ricerca (Dott.Ric.)and PhD.The old Diploma di specializzazione took two to six years and gave the academic title of Specialista.Universities in Italy offer a number of other qualifications including the Master universitario di primo livello (1 year/60 ECTS credits, 2nd cycle qualification) and the Master universitario di secondo livello (1 year/60 ECTS credits, 3rd cycle qualification), following on from the laurea and the laurea magistrale/specialistica respectively.These do not give access to the PhD.

The Diploma di specializzazione, which is offered in a few specific professions, takes two to six years and gives the title of specialista.The Diploma di perfezionamento is a university certificate, aimed at professional training or in specific study fields, which usually takes one year; it is not allocated a level on the framework.AFAM institutions may offer Diploma di perfezionamento o Master and Diploma accademico di specializzazione.These are one year and two year qualifications respectively and may be offered at second cycle or third cycle level, distinguished by adding (I) or (II) after the qualification name.Higher Schools for Language Mediators offer the Diploma di mediatore linguistico, a first cycle degree taking three years (180 ECTS credits), which gives access to the laurea specialistica.Specialisation Institutes/Schools in Psychoterapy offer the Diploma di specializzazione in psicoterapia, a third cycle qualification taking at least four years and requiring a laurea magistrale/specialistica in either Psychology or Medicine and Surgery, along with professional registration.-- -- -- -- Netherlands  -- -- -- --

In the Netherlands, the structure of academic studies was altered significantly in 1982 when the "Tweefasenstructuur" (Two Phase Structure) was introduced by the Dutch Minister of Education, Wim Deetman.With this two phase structure an attempt was made to standardise all the different studies and structure them to an identical timetable.Additional effect was that students would be persuaded stringently to produce results within a preset time-frame or otherwise discontinue their studies.The two phase structure has been adapted to a bachelor-master structure as a result of the Bologna process.-- -- -- -- -- Admission  -- -- -- -- --
In order for a Dutch student to get access to a university education, the student must complete a six-year pre-university secondary education called "voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs" (vwo).There are other routes possible, but only if the end level of the applicant is comparable to the two levels is access to university education is granted.For some studies, specific end levels or disciplines are required, e.g., graduating without physics, biology and chemistry will make it impossible to study medicine.People 21 years old or older who do not have the required entrance diplomas may opt for an entrance exam for being admitted to a higher education curriculum.In this exam, they have to prove their command of disciplines considered necessary for pursuing such study.After September 1, 2002 they would be thus admitted to a Bachelor's curriculum, not to a Master's curriculum.For some studies in the Netherlands, a governmental determined limited access is in place (although under political review for abolishment, February 2011).This is a limitation of the number of applicants to a specific study, thus trying to control the eventual number of graduates.The most renowned studies for their numerus clausus are medicine and dentistry.Every year a combination of the highest pre-university graduation grades and some additional conditions determine who can start such a numerus clausus study and who can not.Almost all Dutch universities are government supported universities, with only very few privately owned universities in existence (i.e.one in business and all others in theology).Leiden University is the oldest, founded in 1575.-- -- -- -- -- Pre-Bologna phases  -- -- -- -- --
Before the introduction of the bachelor-master structure, almost all academic studies in the Netherlands had the same length of four years and had two phases:

The "propedeutische fase" (1–2 years): After finishing this phase a student can follow another two years' study, which grants equivalents to the Anglo-Saxon BSc (Bachelor of Science), BA (Bachelor of Arts) or LLB (Bachelor of Laws).The "doctorale fase" (3–4 years): Completing the first phase successfully gives the student access to the second phase.Again, failure to finish within the time given will lead to discontinuation.This phase is concluded with the "doctoraal examen" (doctoral exam).This is not similar to any type of doctoral exam that would grant the student with any type of PhD title.Successful completion however does grant the student the Dutch degree of "drs.""doctorandus", ir.("ingenieur" – engineer) or "mr." ("Meester in de rechten" - master of law).

Nowadays these Dutch titles have been largely replaced by the Anglo Saxon titles MSc (Master of Science), MA (Master of Arts) and LLM (Master of Laws), depending on the area of study.For medical students the "doctorandus" degree is not equivalent to the European Anglo Saxon postgraduate research degree in medicine of MD (Medical Doctor).Besides the title doctorandus, the graduates of the Curius curriculum may also bear the title arts (physician).The doctorandus in medicine title is granted after four years (nominal time) of the Curius curriculum, while the title physician is granted after six years (nominal time) of that curriculum.The Dutch physician title is equal to a MSc degree according to the Bologna process and can be compared with the MBBS in the UK degree system and the North American MD, but not the UK MD degree, which is a research degree.One-on-one equivalence or interchangeability of the Dutch medical title and MD is often suggested.However, officially the MD title is not known, nor legal to use in the Netherlands.The correct notation for a Dutch physician who completed his or her medical studies, but did not pursue a doctor (PhD-like) study is "drs."(e.g.drs.Jansen, arts) and not "dr." in medicine, as often used incorrectly.However, like in the United Kingdom, physicians holding these degrees are referred to as 'Doctor' by courtesy.In the Netherlands, there is the informal title dokter for physicians, but not doctor (dr.), unless they also earn such degree by completing a PhD curriculum.Furthermore, the "doctorandus" degree does not give a medical student the right to treat patients; for this a minimum of two years additional study (internships) is required.After obtaining a Medical Board registration, Dutch physicians must work an additional two to six years in a field of expertise to become a registered medical specialist.Dutch surgeons commonly are only granted access to surgeon training and positions after obtaining a doctorate (PhD) successfully.In recent years, the six-year (nominal time) old Curius curriculum (which offered the titles doctorandus and physician) has been replaced with a three-year (nominal time) Bachelor Curius+ followed by a three-year (nominal time) Master Curius+.Those who had already begun their old-style Curius curriculum before that will still have to complete it as a six-year study (nominal time).A doctorandus in law uses the title "meester" (master, abbreviated as mr. Jansen) instead of drs.and some studies like for example technique and agriculture grant the title "ingenieur" (engineer, noted as ir.Jansen) instead of drs.These titles as equivalent to an LL.M (the title mr.) and to a MSc (the title ir.)and if got before September 1, 2002 from a recognized Dutch university, may be rendered as M (from Master) behind one's name, instead of using the typical Dutch shortcuts before one's name.Since September 1, 2002, Dutch universities offer specific BSc, BA or LLB studies followed by MSc, MA or LLM studies, thus integrating into and merging with the international scientific community, offering lectures, other classes, seminars or complete curricula in English instead of Dutch.According to their field of study, MSc graduates may use either ir.or drs.before their names, MA graduates may use drs.before their name and LLM graduates may use mr. before their names, but only if they received such degrees from recognized Dutch universities.Not uncommonly, the Dutch "drs."abbreviation can cause much confusion in other countries, since it is perceived as a person who has a PhD in multiple disciplines.In the Netherlands, the degree MPhil is not legally recognised.
