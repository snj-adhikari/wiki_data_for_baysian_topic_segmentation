Capella , designated α Aurigae (Latinized to Alpha Aurigae, abbreviated Alpha Aur, α Aur), is the brightest star in the constellation of Auriga, the sixth-brightest star in the night sky, and the third-brightest in the northern celestial hemisphere after Arcturus and Vega.A prominent object in the northern winter sky, it is circumpolar to observers north of 44°N.Its name meaning "little goat" in Latin, Capella depicted the goat Amalthea that suckled Zeus in classical mythology.Capella is relatively close, at only 42.9 light-years (13.2 pc) from the Sun.Although it appears to be a single star to the naked eye, Capella is actually a quadruple star system organized in two binary pairs, made up of the stars Capella Aa, Capella Ab, Capella H, and Capella L.   
The primary pair, Capella Aa and Capella Ab, are two bright yellow giant stars, both of which are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun.The secondary pair, Capella H and Capella L, are around 10,000 astronomical units (AU) from the first and are two faint, small and relatively cool red dwarfs.Capella Aa and Capella Ab have exhausted their core hydrogen, and cooled and expanded, moving off the main sequence.They are in a very tight circular orbit about 0.74 AU apart, and orbit each other every 104 days.Capella Aa is the cooler and more luminous of the two with spectral class K0III; it is 78.7 ± 4.2 times the Sun's luminosity and 11.98 ± 0.57 times its radius.An ageing red clump star, Capella Aa is fusing helium to carbon and oxygen in its core.Capella Ab is slightly smaller and hotter and of spectral class G1III; it is 72.7 ± 3.6 times as luminous as the Sun and 8.83 ± 0.33 times its radius.It is in the Hertzsprung gap, corresponding to a brief subgiant evolutionary phase as it expands and cools to become a red giant.Capella is one of the brightest X-ray sources in the sky, thought to come primarily from the corona of Capella Aa.Several other stars in the same visual field have been catalogued as companions but are physically unrelated.-- -- Nomenclature  -- --
α Aurigae (Latinised to Alpha Aurigae) is the star system's Bayer designation.It also has the Flamsteed designation 13 Aurigae.It is listed in several multiple star catalogues as ADS 3841, CCDM J05168+4559, and WDS J05167+4600.As a relatively nearby star system, Capella is listed in the Gliese-Jahreiss Catalogue with designations GJ 194 for the bright pair of giants and GJ 195 for the faint pair of red dwarfs.The traditional name Capella is Latin for (small) female goat; the alternative name Capra was more commonly used in classical times.In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars.
==========
The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Capella for this star.It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.The catalogue of star names lists Capella as applying to the star α Aurigae Aa.-- -- Observational history  -- --
Capella was the brightest star in the night sky from 210,000 years ago to 160,000 years ago, at about −1.8 in apparent magnitude.At −1.1, Aldebaran was brightest before this period; it and Capella were situated rather close to each other in the sky and approximated boreal pole stars at the time.Capella is thought to be mentioned in an Akkadian inscription dating to the 20th century BC.Its goat-associated symbolism dates back to Mesopotamia as a constellation called "GAM", "Gamlum" or "MUL.GAM" in the 7th-century BC document MUL.APIN.GAM represented a scimitar or crook and may have represented the star alone or the constellation of Auriga as a whole.Later, Bedouin astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal.The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology.It is sometimes called the Shepherd's Star in English literature.Capella was seen as a portent of rain in classical times.Building J of the pre-Columbian site Monte Albán in Oaxaca state in Mexico was built around 275 BC, at a different orientation to other structures in the complex.Its steps are aligned perpendicular to the rising of Capella at that time, so that a person looking out a doorway on the building would have faced it directly.Capella is significant as its heliacal rising took place within a day of the Sun passing directly overhead over Monte Albán.-- -- -- Multiple status  -- -- --
Professor William Wallace Campbell of the Lick Observatory announced that Capella was binary in 1899, based on spectroscopic observations—he noted on photographic plates taken from August 1896 to February 1897 that a second spectrum appeared superimposed over the first, and that there was a doppler shift to violet in September and October and to red in November and February—showing that the components were moving toward and away from the Earth (and hence orbiting each other).Almost simultaneously, British astronomer Hugh Newall had observed its composite spectrum with a four prism spectroscope attached to a 25 inches (64 cm) telescope at Cambridge in July 1899, concluding that it was a binary star system.Many observers tried to discern the component stars without success.Known as "The Interferometrist's Friend", it was first resolved interferometrically in 1919 by John Anderson and Francis Pease at Mount Wilson Observatory, who published an orbit in 1920 based on their observations.This was the first interferometric measurement of any object outside the Solar System.A high-precision orbit was published in 1994 based on observations by the Mark III Stellar Interferometer, again at Mount Wilson Observatory.Capella also became the first astronomical object to be imaged by a separate element optical interferometer when it was imaged by the Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope in September 1995.In 1914, Finnish astronomer Ragnar Furuhjelm observed that the spectroscopic binary had a faint companion star, which, as its proper motion was similar to that of the spectroscopic binary, was probably physically bound to it.
==========
In February 1936, Carl L. Stearns observed that this companion appeared to be double itself; this was confirmed in September that year by Gerard Kuiper.This pair are designated Capella H and L.


 -- -- -- X-ray source  -- -- --
Two Aerobee-Hi rocket flights on September 20, 1962, and March 15, 1963, detected and confirmed an X-ray source in Auriga at RA  05h 09m Dec +45°, identified as Capella.Stellar X-ray astronomy started on April 5, 1974, with the detection of X-rays from Capella.A rocket flight on that date briefly calibrated its attitude control system when a star sensor pointed the payload axis at Capella.During this period, X-rays in the range 0.2–1.6 keV were detected by an X-ray reflector system co-aligned with the star sensor.The X-ray luminosity (Lx) of ~1024 W (1031 erg s−1) is four orders of magnitude above the Sun's X-ray luminosity.Capella's X-rays are thought to be primarily from the corona of the more massive star.Capella is ROSAT X-ray source 1RXS J051642.2+460001.The high temperature of Capella's corona as obtained from the first coronal X-ray spectrum of Capella using HEAO 1 would require magnetic confinement, unless it is a free-flowing coronal wind.-- -- Observation  -- --

With an average apparent magnitude of +0.08, Capella is the brightest object in the constellation Auriga, the sixth-brightest star in the night sky, the third-brightest in the northern celestial hemisphere (after Arcturus and Vega), and the fourth-brightest visible to the naked eye from the latitude 40°N.It appears to be a rich yellowish-white colour, although the yellow colour is more apparent during daylight observation with a telescope, due to the contrast against the blue sky.Capella is closer to the north celestial pole than any other first magnitude star.Its northern declination is such that it is actually invisible south of latitude 44°S—this includes southernmost New Zealand, Argentina and Chile as well as the Falkland Islands.Conversely it is circumpolar north of 44°N: for the whole of the United Kingdom, Canada and the northernmost United States, the star never sets.Capella and Vega are on opposite sides of the pole, at about the same distance from it, such that an imaginary line between the two stars will nearly pass through Polaris.Visible halfway between Orion's Belt and Polaris, Capella is at its highest in the night sky at midnight in early December and is regarded as a prominent star of the northern winter sky.A few degrees to the southwest of Capella lie three stars, Epsilon Aurigae, Zeta Aurigae, and Eta Aurigae, the latter two of which are known as "The Kids", or Haedi.The four form a familiar pattern, or asterism, in the sky.-- -- Distance  -- --
Based on an annual parallax shift of 76.20 milliarcseconds (with a margin of error of 0.46 milliarcseconds) as measured by the Hipparcos satellite, this system is estimated to be 42.8 light-years (13.12 parsecs) from Earth, with a margin of error of 0.3 light-years (0.09 parsecs).An alternative method to determine the distance is via the orbital parallax, which gives a distance of 42.92 light-years (13.159 parsecs) with a margin of error of only 0.1%.Capella is estimated to have been a little closer to the Solar System in the past, passing within 29 light-years distant around 237,000 years ago.At this range, it would have shone at apparent magnitude −0.82, comparable to Canopus today.In a 1960 paper, American astronomer Olin J. Eggen concluded that Capella was a member of the Hyades moving group, a group of stars moving in the same direction as the Hyades cluster, after analysing its proper motion and parallax.
==========
Members of the group are of a similar age, and those that are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun have moved off the main sequence after exhausting their core hydrogen reserves and are expanding and cooling into red giants.-- -- Stellar system  -- --

There are several stars within a few arc minutes of Capella and some have been listed as companions in various multiple star catalogues.The Washington Double Star Catalog lists components A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, O, P, Q, and R, with A being the naked-eye star.Most are only line-of-sight companions, but the close pair of red dwarfs H and L are at the same distance as the bright component A and moving through space along with it.Capella A is itself a spectroscopic binary with components Aa and Ab, both giant stars.The pair of giants is separated from the pair of red dwarfs by 723".American astronomer Robert Burnham Jr. described a scale model of the system where Capella A was represented by spheres 13 and 7 inches across, separated by ten feet.The red dwarfs were then each 0.7 inches across and they were separated by 420 feet.At this scale, the two pairs are 21 miles apart.-- -- -- Capella A  -- -- --

Capella A consists of two yellow evolved stars that have been calculated to orbit each other every 104.02128 ± 0.00016 days, with a semimajor axis of 111.11 ± 0.10 million km (0.74272 ± 0.00069 au), roughly the distance between Venus and the Sun.The pair is not an eclipsing binary—that is, as seen from Earth, neither star passes in front of the other.The orbit is known extremely accurately and can be used to derive an orbital parallax with far better precision than the one measured directly.The stars are not near enough to each other for the Roche lobe of either star to have been filled and any significant mass transfer to have taken place, even during the red giant stage of the primary star.Modern convention designates the more luminous cooler star as component Aa and its spectral type has been usually measured between G2 and K0.The hotter secondary Ab has been given various spectral types of late (cooler) F or early (warmer) G. The MK spectral types of the two stars have been measured a number of times, and they are both consistently assigned a luminosity class of III indicating a giant star.The composite spectrum appears to be dominated by the primary star due to its sharper absorption lines; the lines from the secondary are broadened and blurred by its rapid rotation.The composite spectral class is given as approximately G3III, but with a specific mention of features due to a cooler component.The most recent specific published types are K0III and G1III, although older values are still widely quoted such as G5IIIe + G0III from the Bright Star Catalogue or G8III + G0III by Eggen.Where the context is clear, these two components have been referred to as A and B.The individual apparent magnitudes of the two component stars cannot be directly measured, but their relative brightness has been measured at various wavelengths.They have very nearly equal brightness in the visible light spectrum, with the hotter secondary component generally being found to be a few tenths of a magnitude brighter.A 2016 measurement gives the magnitude difference between the two stars at a wavelength of 700 nm as 0.00 ± 0.1.The physical properties of the two stars can be determined with high accuracy.The masses are derived directly from the orbital solution, with Aa being 2.5687 ± 0.0074 M☉ and Ab being 2.4828 ± 0.0067 M☉.
==========
Their angular radii have been directly measured; in combination with the very accurate distance, this gives 11.98 ± 0.57 R☉ and 8.83 ± 0.33 R☉ for Aa and Ab respectively.Their surface temperatures can be calculated by comparison of observed and synthetic spectra, direct measurement of their angular diameters and brightnesses, calibration against their observed colour indices, and disentangling of high resolution spectra.Weighted averages of these four methods give 4,970 ± 50 K for Aa and 5,730 ± 60 for Ab.Their bolometric luminosities are most accurately derived from their apparent magnitudes and bolometric corrections, but are confirmed by calculation from the temperatures and radii of the stars.Aa is 78.7 ± 4.2 times as luminous as the Sun and Ab 72.7 ± 3.6 times as luminous, so the star defined as the primary component is the more luminous when all wavelengths are considered but very slightly less bright at visual wavelengths.Estimated to be 590 to 650 million years old, the stars were probably at the hot end of spectral class A during their main sequence lifetime, similar to Vega.They have now exhausted their core hydrogen and evolved off the main sequence, their outer layers expanding and cooling.Despite the giant luminosity class, the secondary component is very clearly within the Hertzsprung gap on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, still expanding and cooling towards the red giant branch, making it a subgiant in evolutionary terms.The more massive primary has already passed through this stage, when it reached a maximum radius of 36 to 38 times that of the Sun.It is now a red clump star which is fusing helium to carbon and oxygen in its core, a process that has not yet begun for the less massive star.Detailed analysis shows that it is nearing the end of this stage and starting to expand again which will lead it to the asymptotic giant branch.Isotope abundances and spin rates confirm this evolutionary difference between the two stars.Heavy element abundances are broadly comparable to those of the Sun and the overall metallicity is slightly less than the Sun's.The rotational period of each star can be measured by observing periodic variations in the doppler shifts of their spectral lines.The absolute rotational velocities of the two stars are known from their inclinations, rotation periods, and sizes, but the projected equatorial rotational velocities measured using doppler broadening of spectral lines are a standard measure and these are generally quoted.Capella Aa has a projected rotational velocity of 4.1 ± 0.4 km per second, taking 104 ± 3 days to complete one rotation, while Capella Ab spins much more rapidly at 35.0±0.5 km per second, completing a full rotation in only 8.5 ± 0.2 days.Rotational braking occurs in all stars when they expand into giants, and binary stars are also tidally braked.Capella Aa has slowed until it is rotationally locked to the orbital period, although theory predicts that it should still be rotating more quickly from a starting point of a rapidly-spinning main sequence A star.Capella has long been suspected to be slightly variable.Its amplitude of about 0.1 magnitudes means that it may at times be brighter or fainter than Rigel, Betelgeuse, and Vega, which are also variable.The system has been classified as an RS Canum Venaticorum variable, a class of binary stars with active chromospheres that cause huge starspots, but it is still only listed as a suspected variable in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars.Unusually for RS CVn systems, the hotter star, Capella Ab, has the more active atmosphere because it is located in the Hertzsprung gap—a stage where it is changing its angular momentum and deepening its convection zone.The active atmospheres and closeness of these stars means that they are among the brightest X-ray sources in the sky.However the X-ray emission is due to stable coronal structures and not eruptive flaring activity.
==========
Coronal loops larger than the Sun and with temperatures of several million K are likely to be responsible for the majority of the X-rays.-- -- -- Capella HL  -- -- --
The seventh companion published for Capella, component H, is physically associated with the bright primary star.It is a red dwarf separated from the pair of G-type giants by a distance of around 10,000 AU.It has its own close companion, an even fainter red dwarf that was 1.8" away when it was discovered in 1935.Eighty years later the separation had increased to 3.5", sufficient to allow tentative orbital parameters to be derived.It is component L in double star catalogues.The Gliese-Jahreiss Catalogue of nearby stars designates the binary system as GJ 195.The two components are then referred to individually as GJ 195 A and B.The two stars are reported to have a 3.5 visual magnitude difference, 2.3 mag in the passband of the Gaia spacecraft, although the difference is much smaller at infrared wavelengths.This is unexpected and may indicate further unseen companions.The mass of the stars can be determined from the orbital motion, but uncertainties in the orbit have led to widely varying results.In 1975, an eccentric 388 year orbit gave masses of 0.65 M☉ and 0.13 M☉.A smaller near-circular orbit published in 2015 had a 300-year orbit, benefitting from mass constraints of 0.57 M☉ and 0.53 M☉ respectively for GJ 195 A and B based on their infrared magnitudes.-- -- -- Visual companions  -- -- --
Six visual companions to Capella were discovered before Capella H and are generally known only as Capella B through G. None are thought to be physically associated with Capella although all appear closer in the sky than the HL pair.Component F is also known as TYC 3358-3142-1.It is listed with a spectral type of K although it is included in a catalogue of OB stars as a distant luminous star.Component G is BD+45 1076, with a spectral type of F0, at a distance of 401 light-years (123 parsecs).It is identified as a variable member of the Guide Star Catalogue from Chandra observations although it is not known what type of variability.It is known to be an X-ray source with an active corona.Several other stars have also been catalogued as companions to Capella.Components I, Q, and R are 13th magnitude stars at distances of 92", 133", and 134".V538 Aurigae and its close companion HD 233153 are red dwarfs ten degrees away from Capella; they have very similar space motions but the small difference makes it possible that this is just a coincidence.Two faint stars have been discovered by speckle imaging in the Capella HL field, around 10" distant from that pair.
==========
These have been catalogued as Capella O and P. It is not known whether they are physically associated with the red dwarf binary.-- -- Etymology and culture  -- --
Capella traditionally marks the left shoulder of the constellation's eponymous charioteer, or, according to the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy's Almagest, the goat that the charioteer is carrying.In Bayer's 1603 work Uranometria, Capella marks the charioteer's back.The three Haedi had been identified as a separate constellation by Pliny the Elder and Manilius, and were called Capra, Caper, or Hircus, all of which relate to its status as the "goat star".Ptolemy merged the Charioteer and the Goats in the 2nd century Almagest.In Greek mythology, the star represented the goat Amalthea that suckled Zeus.It was this goat whose horn, after accidentally being broken off by Zeus, was transformed into the Cornucopia, or "horn of plenty", which would be filled with whatever its owner desired.Though most often associated with Amalthea, Capella has sometimes been associated with Amalthea's owner, a nymph.The myth of the nymph says that the goat's hideous appearance, resembling a Gorgon, was partially responsible for the Titans' defeat, after Zeus skinned the goat and wore it as his aegis.In medieval accounts, it bore the uncommon name Alhajoth (also spelled Alhaior, Althaiot, Alhaiset, Alhatod, Alhojet, Alanac, Alanat, Alioc), which (especially the last) may be a corruption of its Arabic name, العيوق, al-cayyūq.cAyyūq has no clear significance in Arabic, but may be an Arabized form of the Greek αίξ aiks "goat"; cf.the modern Greek Αίγα Aiga, the feminine of goat.To the Bedouin of the Negev and Sinai, Capella al-'Ayyūq ath-Thurayyā "Capella of the Pleiades", from its role as pointing out the position of that asterism.Another name in Arabic was Al-Rākib "the driver", a translation of the Greek.To the ancient Balts, Capella was known as Perkūno Ožka "Thunder's Goat", or Tikutis.Conversely in Slavic Macedonian folklore, Capella was Jastreb "the hawk", flying high above and ready to pounce on Mother Hen (the Pleiades) and the Rooster (Nath).Astrologically, Capella portends civic and military honors and wealth.In the Middle Ages, it was considered a Behenian fixed star, with the stone sapphire and the plants horehound, mint, mugwort, and mandrake as attributes.Cornelius Agrippa listed its kabbalistic sign  with the name Hircus (Latin for goat).In Hindu mythology, Capella was seen as the heart of Brahma, Brahma Hṛdaya.In traditional Chinese astronomy, Capella was part of the asterism 五車 (Wŭ chē; English: Five Chariots), which consisted of Capella together with Beta Aurigae, Theta Aurigae, and Iota Aurigae, as well as Beta Tauri.Since it was the second star in this asterism, it has the Chinese name 五車二 (Wŭ chē èr; English: Second of the Five Chariots).In Quechua it was known as Colça; the Incas held the star in high regard.The Hawaiians saw Capella as part of an asterism Ke ka o Makali'i ("The canoe bailer of Makali'i") that helped them navigate at sea.Called Hoku-lei "star wreath", it formed this asterism with Procyon, Sirius, Castor and Pollux.In Tahitian folklore, Capella was Tahi-ari'i, the wife of Fa'a-nui (Auriga) and mother of prince Ta'urua (Venus) who sails his canoe across the sky.
==========
In Inuit astronomy, Capella, along with Menkalinan (Beta Aurigae), Pollux (Beta Geminorum) and Castor (Alpha Geminorum), formed a constellation Quturjuuk, "collar-bones", the two pairs of stars denoting a bone each.Used for navigation and time-keeping at night, the constellation was recognised from Alaska to western Greenland.The Gwich'in saw Capella and Menkalinan has forming shreets'ą įį vidzee, the right ear of the large circumpolar constellation Yahdii, which covered much of the night sky, and whose orientation facilitated navigation and timekeeping.In Australian Aboriginal mythology for the Boorong people of Victoria, Capella was Purra, the kangaroo, pursued and killed by the nearby Gemini twins, Yurree (Castor) and Wanjel (Pollux).The Wardaman people of northern Australia knew the star as Yagalal, a ceremonial fish scale, related to Guwamba the barramundi (Aldebaran).-- -- Namesakes  -- --

The 18th century lasted from January 1, 1701 to December 31, 1800.During the 18th century, elements of Enlightenment thinking culminated in the American, French, and Haitian revolutions.This was an age of violent slave trading, and global human trafficking.The reactions against monarchical and aristocratic power helped fuel the revolutionary responses against it throughout the century.The period is also known as the "century of lights" or the "century of reason".In continental Europe, philosophers dreamed of a brighter age.For some, this dream turned into a reality with the French Revolution of 1789, though later compromised by the excesses of the Reign of Terror (1793–1794) under Maximilien Robespierre.At first, many monarchies of Europe embraced Enlightenment ideals, but with the French Revolution they feared losing their power and formed broad coalitions for the counter-revolution.The Ottoman Empire experienced an unprecedented period of peace and economic expansion, taking part in no European wars from 1740 to 1768.As a consequence the empire did not share in Europe's military improvements during the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), causing its military to fall behind and suffer defeats against Russia in the second half of the century.18th century music included the Late Baroque period (including Johan Sebastian Bach and George Frederic Handel) and the classical period (including Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart).The 18th century also marked the end of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as an independent state.The once-powerful and vast kingdom, which had once conquered Moscow and defeated great Ottoman armies, collapsed under numerous invasions.Its semi-democratic government system was not robust enough to rival the neighboring monarchies of the Kingdom of Prussia, the Russian Empire and the Austrian Empire which divided the Commonwealth territories between themselves, changing the landscape of Central European politics for the next hundred years.European colonization of the Americas and other parts of the world intensified and associated mass migrations of people grew in size as the Age of Sail continued.Great Britain became a major power worldwide with the French and Indian War in the 1760s and the conquest of large parts of India, especially Bengal.However, Britain lost many of its North American colonies after the American Revolution and Indian wars.In Central Asia, Nader Shah caused major invasions and led successful military campaigns and the Durrani Empire was founded.In the Indian subcontinent, the death of the Islamic Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb marks the end of the medieval India and the beginning of the modern India and the beginning of European invasion India.The victory of the British East India Company over the Nawab of Bengal and their French allies in the Battle of Plassey caused the deindustrialization of Bengal and the beginning of the British Industrial Revolution which radically changed human society and the environment.
==========
The British invasion since then expanded to cover much of South Asia.French-Italian emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, formed one of the Franco-Indian alliances with the major economic power Kingdom of Mysore, governed by Tipu Sultan and his father Hyder Ali, who pioneered the use of Rocket artillery and the world's first iron-cased rockets, the Mysorean rockets, through the compilation of the Fathul Mujahidin.The Anglo-Mysore Wars were fought  and the Treaty of Mangalore was initiated in 1784.The defeat of the British resulted in the formation of the newly independent United States.Western historians have occasionally defined the 18th century otherwise for the purposes of their work.For example, the "short" 18th century may be defined as 1715–1789, denoting the period of time between the death of Louis XIV of France and the start of the French Revolution, with an emphasis on directly interconnected events.To historians who expand the century to include larger historical movements, the "long" 18th century may run from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 or even later.-- -- Events  -- --

The terms A-side and B-side refer to the two sides of 78, 45, and 33​1⁄3 rpm phonograph records, or cassettes, whether singles, extended plays (EPs), or long-playing (LP) records.The A-side usually featured the recording that the artist, record producer, or the record company intended to receive the initial promotional effort and then receive radio airplay, hopefully, to become a "hit" record.The B-side (or "flip-side") is a secondary recording that has a history of its own: some artists released B-sides that were considered as strong as the A-side and became hits in their own right.Others took the opposite approach: producer Phil Spector was in the habit of filling B-sides with on-the-spot instrumentals that no one would confuse with the A-side.With this practice, Spector was assured that airplay was focused on the side he wanted to be the hit side.Music recordings have moved away from records onto other formats such as CDs and digital downloads, which do not have "sides", but the terms are still used to describe the type of content, with B-side sometimes standing for "bonus" track.-- -- History  -- --
The first sound recordings at the end of the 19th century were made on cylinder records, which had a single round surface capable of holding approximately two minutes of sound.Early shellac disc records records only had recordings on one side of the disc, with a similar capacity (both media could hold between three and four minutes by 1910).Double-sided recordings, with one selection on each side, were introduced in Europe by Columbia Records in 1908, and by 1910 most record labels had adopted the format in both Europe and the United States; the ability to effectively double the amount of sound on the disc was one major factor in its rising to dominance over the cylinder record which was obsolete by 1912.There were no record charts until the 1930s, and radio stations (by and large) did not play recorded music until the 1950s (when top 40 radio overtook full-service network radio).In this time, A-sides and B-sides existed, but neither side was considered more important; the "side" did not convey anything about the content of the record.In June 1948, Columbia Records introduced the modern 33​1⁄3 rpm long-playing (LP) microgroove vinyl record for commercial sales, and its rival RCA Victor, responded the next year with the seven-inch 45 rpm vinylite record, which would quickly replace the 78 for single record releases.The term "single" came into popular use with the advent of vinyl records in the early 1950s.At first, most record labels would randomly assign which song would be an A-side and which would be a B-side.(All records have specific identifiers for each side in addition to the catalog number for the record itself; the "A" side would typically be assigned a sequentially lower number.)Under this random system, many artists had so-called "double-sided hits", where both songs on a record made one of the national sales charts (in Billboard, Cashbox, or other magazines), or would be featured on jukeboxes in public places.As time wore on, however, the convention for assigning songs to sides of the record changed.By the early sixties, the song on the A-side was the song that the record company wanted radio stations to play, as 45 rpm single records (or '45s') dominated the market in terms of cash sales.It was not until 1968, for example, that the total production of albums on a unit basis finally surpassed that of singles in the United Kingdom.In the late 1960s, stereo versions of pop and rock songs began to regularly appear on 45s.The majority of the 45s were played on AM radio stations, which were not equipped for stereo broadcast at the time, so stereo was not a priority.However, the FM rock stations did not like to play monaural content, so the record companies adopted a protocol for DJ versions with the mono version of the song on one side, and stereo version of the same song on the other.By the early 1970s, double-sided hits had become rare.Album sales had increased, and B-sides had become the side of the record where non-album, non-radio-friendly, instrumental versions or simply inferior recordings were placed.In order to further ensure that radio stations played the side that the record companies had chosen, it was common for the promotional copies (DJ version) of a single to have the "plug side" on both sides of the disc.With the decline of 45 rpm vinyl records, after the introduction of cassette and compact disc singles in the late 1980s, the A-side/B-side differentiation became much less meaningful.At first, cassette singles would often have one song on each side of the cassette, matching the arrangement of vinyl records, but eventually, cassette maxi-singles, containing more than two songs, became more popular.Cassette singles were phased out beginning in the late 1990s, and the A-side/B-side dichotomy became virtually extinct, as the remaining dominant medium, the compact disc, lacked an equivalent physical distinction.However, the term "B-side" is still used to refer to the "bonus" tracks or "coupling" tracks on a CD single.
==========
With the advent of downloading music via the Internet, sales of CD singles and other physical media have declined, and the term "B-side" is now less commonly used.Songs that were not part of an artist's collection of albums are made available through the same downloadable catalogs as tracks from their albums, and are usually referred to as "unreleased", "bonus", "non-album", "rare", "outtakes" or "exclusive" tracks, the latter in the case of a song being available solely from a certain provider of music.-- -- Significance  -- --
B-side songs may be released on the same record as a single to provide extra "value for money".There are several types of material commonly released in this way, including a different version (e.g., instrumental, a cappella, live, acoustic, remixed version or in another language), or, in a concept record, a song that does not fit into the story line.Additionally, it was common in the 1960s and 1970s for longer songs, especially by soul, funk, and R&B acts, to be broken into two parts for single release.Examples of this include Ray Charles's "What'd I Say", the Isley Brothers' "Shout", and a number of records by James Brown, including "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag" and "Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud".Typically, "part one" would be the chart hit, while "part two" would be a continuation of the same performance.A notable example of a non-R&B hit with two parts was the single release of Don McLean's "American Pie".With the advent of the 12in single in the late 1970s, the part one/part two method of recording was largely abandoned.Modern day examples are Fall Out Boy's EP, My Heart Will Always Be The B-Side To My Tongue, or My Chemical Romance's The Black Parade, The B-Sides
Since both sides of a single received equal royalties, some composers deliberately arranged for their songs to be used as the B-sides of singles by popular artists.This became known as the "flipside racket".Similarly, it has also been alleged that owners of pirate radio stations operating off the British coast in the 1960s would buy the publishing rights to the B-sides of records they expected to be hits, and then plug the A-sides in the hope of driving up sales and increasing their share of the royalties.Occasionally, the B-side of a single would become the more popular song.This sometimes occurred because a DJ preferred the B-side to its A-side and played it instead.Some examples include "I Will Survive" by Gloria Gaynor (originally the B-side of "Substitute"), 
"Ice Ice Baby" by Vanilla Ice (originally the B-side of "Play That Funky Music"), "I'll Be Around" by the Spinners (originally the B-side of "How Could I Let You Get Away") and "Maggie May" by Rod Stewart (originally the B-side of "Reason to Believe").Probably the most well-known of these, however, is "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley & His Comets (originally the B-side of "Thirteen Women (And Only One Man In Town))".The song "How Soon Is Now?"by the Smiths started out as the extra track on the 12-inch of William, It Was Really Nothing but later gained a separate release as an A-side in its own right, as did Oasis's "Acquiesce", which originally appeared as a B-side to "Some Might Say" in 1995, but gained subsequent release in 2006 as part of an EP to promote their forthcoming compilation album, Stop the Clocks.Feeder in 2001 and 2005 had the B-sides "Just a Day" from "Seven Days in the Sun", and "Shatter" from "Tumble and Fall" released as A-sides after fan petitions and official website and fansite message board hype, and both charted at No.12 and No.11 in the UK.In 1986, the first single from XTC's record Skylarking, "Grass", was eclipsed in the United States by its B-side, "Dear God" – so much so that the record was almost immediately re-released with one song ("Mermaid Smiled") removed and "Dear God" put in its place, becoming one of the band's better-known hits.On many reissued singles, the A- and B-sides are two hit songs from different albums that were not originally released together, or were by completely different artists, altogether.These were often made for the jukebox, as one record with two popular songs on it would make more money, or to promote an artist to the fans of another.For example, in 1981 Kraftwerk released their new single "Computer Love" coupled with the B-side "The Model", from their 1978 LP The Man-Machine.With synthpop increasingly dominating the UK charts, the single was re-released with the sides reversed.In early 1982 "The Model" reached number one.-- -- Double A-side  -- --
A "double A-side" is a single where both sides are designated the A-side; there is no B-side on such a single.In 1949, Savoy Records promoted a new single by one of its artists, Paul Williams' "House Rocker" and "He Knows How to Hucklebuck", as "The New Double Side Hit – Both Sides "A" Sides".In 1965, Billboard reported that due to a disagreement between EMI and John Lennon about which side of the Beatles' "We Can Work It Out" and "Day Tripper" single should be considered the A-side and receive the plugging, "EMI settled for a double-side promotion campaign—unique in Britain."They continued to use the format for the release of the singles "Eleanor Rigby" and "Yellow Submarine" in 1966, followed by "Strawberry Fields Forever" / "Penny Lane" in 1967, and "Something" / "Come Together" in 1969.
==========
Other groups followed suit, notably the Rolling Stones in early 1967 with "Let's Spend the Night Together" / "Ruby Tuesday" as a double-A single.A double A-sided single is often confused with a single where both sides, the A and the B, became hits.Although many artists in the late 1950s and early 1960s like Elvis Presley, the Everly Brothers, Fats Domino, Ricky Nelson, the Beach Boys, Brenda Lee, and Pat Boone, routinely had hit singles where both sides of the 45 received airplay, these were not double A-sides.The charts below tally the instances for artists' singles where both sides were hits, not where both sides were designated an A-side upon manufacture and release.For instance "Don't Be Cruel", the B-side of "Hound Dog" by Elvis Presley, became as big a hit as its A-side even though "Don't Be Cruel" was not the intended A-side when released in 1956.Reissues later in the 1960s (and after the Beatles' "Day Tripper"/"We Can Work It Out") listed the single with both songs as the A-side.Also, for Cliff Richard's 1962 "The Next Time"/"Bachelor Boy", both sides were marketed as songs with chart potential, albeit with "Bachelor Boy" pressed as the B-side.In the UK, before the advent of digital downloads, both A-sides were accredited with the same chart position, as the singles' chart was compiled entirely from physical sales.In the UK, the biggest-selling non-charity single of all time was a double A-side, Wings' 1977 release "Mull of Kintyre"/"Girls' School", which sold over two million copies.It was also the UK Christmas No.1 that year, one of only two occasions on which a double A-side has topped that chart, the other being Queen's 1991 re-release of "Bohemian Rhapsody" with "These Are the Days of Our Lives".Nirvana released "All Apologies" and "Rape Me" as a double A-side in 1993, and both songs are accredited as a hit on both the UK Singles Chart, and the Irish Singles Chart.Queen released their first double-A single, "Killer Queen"/"Flick of the Wrist", in 1974."Killer Queen" became a hit, while "Flick of the Wrist" was all but ignored for lack of promotion.Three years later, they released "We Are the Champions" with "We Will Rock You" as a B-side.Both sides of the single received much radio airplay (often one after the other), which led to them sometimes being referred to as a double A-side.In 1978 they released "Fat Bottomed Girls"/"Bicycle Race" as a double A-side; that time both sides of the single became hits.Occasionally double-A-sided singles were released with each side targeting a different market.During the late 1970s, for example, Dolly Parton released a number of double-A-sided singles, in which one side was released to pop radio, and the other side to country, including "Two Doors Down"/"It's All Wrong, But It's All Right" and "Baby I'm Burning"/"I Really Got the Feeling".In 1978, the Bee Gees also used this method when they released "Too Much Heaven" for the pop market and the flip side, "Rest Your Love on Me", which was aimed toward country stations.Many artists continue to release double A-sided singles outside of the US where it is seen as more popular.Examples of this include Oasis's "Little by Little"/"She Is Love" (2002), Bloc Party's "So Here We Are"/"Positive Tension" (2005) and Gorillaz's "El Mañana"/"Kids with Guns" (2006).Artists having the most US double-sided singles on which each side charted in the US Hot 100, according to Billboard:
Perry Como (12) and Nat King Cole (19) both had additional double-sided singles on Billboard's pre-1955 charts.Artists having the most US double-sided singles on which each side reached the Billboard Top 40, according to Billboard:


 -- -- Double B-side  -- --
On vinyl, double A-sided singles had one song on either side of the record, while double B-sides contained two songs on the same side (on the B-side, making three songs in all).When such singles were introduced in the 1970s, the popular term for them was "maxi single", though this term is now used more ambiguously for a variety of formats.For some people these records would not quite qualify as EPs, for those generally have four songs on a 45.Genesis's 1978 7-inch single "Many Too Many" featured two B-sides, "The Day the Light Went Out" and "Vancouver", both of them being outtakes from the ...And Then There Were Three... album.There was no 12-inch equivalent.The band released two 7-inch singles with three tracks apiece, Spot the Pigeon and 3X3 (also known as "Paperlate"), which were explicitly marked as EPs."Spot the Pigeon" was also available in a 12-inch version, and also subverted this format a bit, by having two tracks on the A-side and one track on the B-side.The B-side, "Inside and Out", was also considered the selling point of the EP, being Steve Hackett's last contribution to the band, and remains a favorite of many fans.Paul McCartney's 1980 single "Coming Up" had a studio version of the song on the A-side, while the B-side contained two songs, a live version of "Coming Up" and a studio instrumental called "Lunchbox/Odd Sox".
==========
Iron Maiden's 1980 7-inch single "Sanctuary" was a re-recording of a song that had been given for use on the Metal For Muthas compilation the previous year.The recording was made during the Iron Maiden sessions but was left off the UK version of that album, and was then put out as a single.To help compensate fans who had specifically bought Metal for Muthas for the track, the "Sanctuary" single had two live B-sides which were deliberately selected to be non-album tracks—"I've Got The Fire" (a cover of the Montrose song) and "Drifter".A studio recording of "Drifter" (featuring Adrian Smith instead of Dennis Stratton) appeared on their next album, Killers, and a studio version of "I've Got The Fire" featuring Bruce Dickinson appeared on the B-side of "Flight of Icarus" a few years later.At the time this single was released they were the first live Iron Maiden tracks released (though more would follow), and it remains the only officially released recording of "I've Got The Fire" with Paul Di'Anno on vocals.The singles from U2's album The Joshua Tree were released with two B-side songs each, which were pressed at 33​1⁄3 rpm.Versions for jukeboxes included only one of those songs, which played at 45 rpm.The UK 7-inch single of "Love Shack" by The B-52's was released with live versions of "Planet Claire" and "Rock Lobster" on the B-side, which plays at 33​1⁄3 rpm.The follow-up "Roam" followed suit, including live versions of "Whammy Kiss" and "Dance This Mess Around" on the B-side playing at 33​1⁄3 rpm.The Rolling Stones released "Brown Sugar" from their album Sticky Fingers in May 1971.While the American single featured only "Bitch" as the B-side, the British single added a third track, a live rendition of "Let It Rock" (the Chuck Berry classic) recorded at the University of Leeds during their 1971 tour of the UK.-- -- Humorous implementations  -- --
The concept of the B-side has become so well known that many performers have released parody versions, including:

The 1988 single "Stutter Rap (No Sleep til Bedtime)" by parody band Morris Minor and the Majors featured a B-side titled "Another Boring 'B'-side".Parody band Bad News recorded a video B-side for the VHS version of their single "Bohemian Rhapsody", titled "Every Mistake Imaginable", in which the band discusses that they have to record an extra three minutes of footage for the single to be eligible for the charts.Tracey Ullman's hit "They Don't Know" was backed in the UK by a song entitled "The B Side" and featured Ullman in a variety of comic monologues, many of which bemoaned the uselessness of B-sides.(The US release used the album's title track, "You Broke My Heart in 17 Places", as the B-side.)Paul and Linda McCartney's B-side to Linda McCartney's "Seaside Woman" (released under the alias Suzy and the Red Stripes) was a song called "B-Side to Seaside".The single "O.K.?", from the soundtrack album of the TV series Rock Follies of '77, contained a song called "B-Side?"which featured Charlotte Cornwell tunelessly singing about the fact that she is not considered good enough to sing an A-side.The B-side of the single "They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!"by Napoleon XIV was called "!aaaH-aH, yawA eM ekaT oT gnimoC er'yehT" and the singer billed as "Noelopan VIX".It was the A-side played in reverse; in fact, most of the label affixed to that B-side was a mirror image of the front label (as opposed to being spelled backwards), including the letters in the "WB" shield logo.Blotto's 1981 single "When the Second Feature Starts" features "The B-Side", a song about how bad B-sides are compared to A-sides.Love and Rockets' novelty side project the Bubblemen released only one single in 1988, "The Bubblemen Are Coming" coupled with "The B-Side", which is a field recording of bees.The Wall of Voodoo 1982 12-inch EP Two Songs by Wall of Voodoo has the 10-minute joke track "There's Nothing on This Side" on the B-side.Metric released in 2008 a single entitled "Help, I'm Alive", with a B-side "Help, I'm a B-Side".Three Dog Night's 1973 single "Shambala" featured "Our 'B' Side", about the group wishing it could be trusted to write their own songs for single release.It is the only Three Dog Night single written and produced by the whole group, and features family members on background vocals.Dickie Goodman's 1974 release "Energy Crisis '74" featured "The Mistake" as the B-side, which was simply a false start of the A-side, with Goodman saying, "Mr. President, the crisis...", followed by two minutes of silence.
==========
The 32-bar form, also known as the AABA song form, American popular song form and the ballad form, is a song structure commonly found in Tin Pan Alley songs and other American popular music, especially in the first half of the 20th century.As its alternative name AABA implies, this song form consists of four sections: an eight-bar A section; a second eight-bar A section (which may have slight changes from the first A section); an eight-bar B section, often with contrasting harmony or "feel"; and a final eight-bar A section.The core melody line is generally retained in each A section, although variations may be added, particularly for the last A section.Examples of 32-bar AABA form songs include "Over the Rainbow", "What'll I Do", "Make You Feel My Love", "Blue Skies", and Willie Nelson's "Crazy".Many show tunes that have become jazz standards are 32-bar song forms.-- -- Basic song form  -- --
At its core, the basic AABA 32-bar song form consists of four sections, each section being 8 bars in length, totaling 32 bars.Each of these 8-bar sections is assigned a letter name ("A" or "B"), based on its melodic and harmonic content.The A sections all share the same melody (possibly with slight variations), and the recurring title lyric typically falls on either the first or last line of each A section.The "B" section musically and lyrically contrasts the A sections, and may or may not contain the title lyric.The "B" section may use a different harmony that contrasts with the harmony of the A sections.For example in the song "I've Got Rhythm", the A sections are in the key of B♭, but the B section involves a circle of fifths series of dominant seventh chords going from D7, G7, C7 to F7.Song form terminology is not standardized, and the B section is also referred to as the "middle eight", "bridge", or "primary bridge".The song form of "What'll I Do" by Irving Berlin is as follows:


 -- -- Terminology  -- --


 -- -- -- Sectional verse  -- -- --
Some Tin Pan Alley songs composed as numbers for musicals precede the main tune with what was called a "sectional verse" or "introductory verse" in the terminology of the early 20th century.This introductory section is usually sixteen bars long and establishes the background and mood of the number, and is musically undistinguished in order to highlight the attractions of the main tune.The sectional verse is often omitted from modern performances.It is not assigned a letter in the "AABA" naming scheme.The introductory verse from "What'll I Do" by Irving Berlin is as follows:

Gone is the romance that was so divine,
'tis broken and cannot be mended
You must go your way, and I must go mine,
but now that our love dreams have ended...


 -- -- -- Bridge  -- -- --

In music theory, the middle 8 or bridge is the B section of a 32-bar form.This section has a significantly different melody from the rest of the song and usually occurs after the second "A" section in the AABA song form.It is called a middle 8 because it happens in the middle of the song and the length is generally eight bars.-- -- -- Terminological confusion  -- -- --
In early 20th century terminology, the main 32-bar AABA section, in its entirety, was called the "refrain" or "chorus".This is in contrast to the modern usage of the term "chorus", which refers to a repeating musical and lyrical section in verse–chorus form.Additionally, "verse," "chorus" and "refrain" all have different meanings in modern musical terminology.See the below chart for clarification:


 -- -- History  -- --
Though the 32-bar form resembles the ternary form of the operatic da capo aria, it did not become common until the late 1910s.

==========
During the 20th century there was a huge increase in the variety of music that people had access to.Prior to the invention of mass market gramophone records (developed in 1892) and radio broadcasting (first commercially done ca.1919–20), people mainly listened to music at live Classical music concerts or musical theatre shows, which were too expensive for many lower-income people; on early phonograph players (a technology invented in 1877 which was not mass-marketed until the mid-1890s); or by individuals performing music or singing songs on an amateur basis at home, using sheet music, which required the ability to sing, play, and read music.These were skills that tended to be limited to middle-class and upper-class individuals.With the mass-market availability of gramophone records and radio broadcasts, listeners could purchase recordings of, or listen on radio to recordings or live broadcasts of a huge variety of songs and musical pieces from around the globe.This enabled a much wider range of the population to listen to performances of Classical music symphonies and operas that they would not be able to hear live, either due to not being able to afford live-concert tickets or because such music was not performed in their region.Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be inexpensively and widely distributed nationwide or even, for some artists, worldwide.The development of relatively inexpensive reproduction of music via a succession of formats including vinyl records, compact cassettes, compact discs (introduced in 1983) and, by the mid-1990s, digital audio recordings, and the transmission or broadcast of audio recordings of music performances on radio, of video recordings or live performances on television, and by the 1990s, of audio and video recordings via the Internet, using file sharing of digital audio recordings, gave individuals from a wide range of socioeconomic classes access to a diverse selection of high-quality music performances by artists from around the world.The introduction of multitrack recording in 1955 and the use of mixing had a major influence on pop and rock music, because it enabled record producers to mix and overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.The development of sound recording and audio engineering technologies and the ability to edit these recordings gave rise to new subgenres of classical music, including the Musique concrète (1949) and acousmatic (1955) schools of electronic composition.In the 1970s, African-American hip hop musicians began to use the record turntable as a musical instrument, creating rhythmic and percussive "scratching" effects by manipulating a vinyl record on the turntable.In Beethoven's and Felix Mendelssohn's time in the 19th century, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments which was very rarely modified.As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as Berlioz and Mahler, the 20th century saw that instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer.Saxophones were used in some 20th-century orchestra scores such as Vaughan Williams' Symphonies No.6 and 9 and William Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble.Twentieth-century orchestras  generally include a string section, woodwinds, brass instruments, percussion, piano, celeste, harp(s), with other instruments called for occasionally, such as electric guitar and electric bass.The 20th century saw dramatic innovations in musical forms and styles.Composers and songwriters explored new forms and sounds that challenged the previously accepted rules of music of earlier periods, such as the use of altered chords and extended chords in 1940s-era Bebop jazz.The development of powerful, loud guitar amplifiers and sound reinforcement systems in the 1960s and 1970s permitted bands to hold large concerts where even those with the least expensive tickets could hear the show.Composers and songwriters experimented with new musical styles, such as genre fusions (e.g., the late 1960s fusion of jazz and rock music to create jazz fusion).As well, composers and musicians used new electric, electronic, and digital instruments and musical devices.In the 1980s, some styles of music, such as electronic dance music genres such as house music were created largely with synthesizers and drum machines.Faster modes of transportation such as jet flight allowed musicians and fans to travel more widely to perform or hear shows, which increased the spread of musical styles.

-- -- Classical  -- --


 -- -- -- Modernism  -- -- --

In the early 20th century, many composers, including Rachmaninoff, Richard Strauss, Giacomo Puccini, and Edward Elgar, continued to work in forms and in a musical language that derived from the 19th century.However, modernism in music became increasingly prominent and important; among the most important modernists were Alexander Scriabin, Claude Debussy, and post-Wagnerian composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss, who experimented with form, tonality and orchestration.Busoni, Stravinsky, Schoenberg, and Schreker were already recognized before 1914 as modernists, and Ives was retrospectively also included in this category for his challenges to the uses of tonality.Composers such as Ravel, Milhaud, and Gershwin combined classical and jazz idioms.-- -- -- Nationalism  -- -- --

Late-Romantic and modernist nationalism was found also in British, American, and Latin-American music of the early 20th century.Composers such as Ralph Vaughan Williams, Aaron Copland, Alberto Ginastera, Carlos Chávez, Silvestre Revueltas, and Heitor Villa-Lobos used folk themes collected by themselves or others in many of their major compositions.-- -- -- Microtonal music  -- -- --

In the early decades of the 20th century, composers such as Julián Carrillo, Mildred Couper, Alois Hába, Charles Ives, Erwin Schulhoff, Ivan Wyschnegradsky turned their attention to quarter tones (24 equal intervals per octave), and other finer divisions.In the middle of the century composers such as Harry Partch and Ben Johnston explored just intonation.In the second half of the century, prominent composers employing microtonality included Easley Blackwood, Jr., Wendy Carlos, Adriaan Fokker, Terry Riley, Ezra Sims, Karlheinz Stockhausen, La Monte Young, and Iannis Xenakis.-- -- -- Neoclassicism  -- -- --

A dominant trend in music composed from 1923 to 1950 was neoclassicism, a reaction against the exaggerated gestures and formlessness of late Romanticism which revived the balanced forms and clearly perceptible thematic processes of earlier styles.There were three distinct "schools" of neoclassicism, associated with Igor Stravinsky, Paul Hindemith, and Arnold Schoenberg.Similar sympathies in the second half of the century are generally subsumed under the heading "postmodernism".-- -- -- Experimental music  -- -- --

A compositional tradition arose in the mid-20th century—particularly in North America—called "experimental music".Its most famous and influential exponent was John Cage (1912–1992).According to Cage, "an experimental action is one the outcome of which is not foreseen", and he was specifically interested in completed works that performed an unpredictable action.Some of the composers who influenced John Cage were Erik Satie (1866–1925), Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951) and Henry Dixon Cowell (1897–1965).-- -- -- Minimalism  -- -- --

Minimalist music, involving a simplification of materials and intensive repetition of motives began in the late 1950s with the composers Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass.Later, minimalism was adapted to a more traditional symphonic setting by composers including Reich, Glass, and John Adams.Minimalism was practiced heavily throughout the latter half of the century and has carried over into the 21st century, as well as composers like Arvo Pärt, Henryk Górecki and John Tavener working in the holy minimalism variant.For more examples see List of 20th-century classical composers.-- -- -- Contemporary classical music  -- -- --

Contemporary classical music can be understood as belonging to the period that started in the mid-1970s to early 1990s, which includes modernist, postmodern, neoromantic, and pluralist music.
==========
However, the term  may also be employed in a broader sense to refer to all post-1945 musical forms.Many composers working in the early 21st century were prominent figures in the 20th century.Some younger composers such as Oliver Knussen, Wolfgang Rihm, Georg Friedrich Haas, Judith Weir, George Benson, Richard Barrett, Simon Bainbridge, John Luther Adams, Toshio Hosokawa, Bright Sheng, Kaija Saariaho, Tan Dun, Magnus Lindberg, Philippe Manoury, Olga Neuwirth, Rebecca Saunders, David Lang, Hanspeter Kyburz, James MacMillan, Mark-Anthony Turnage, Thomas Adès, Marc-André Dalbavie, Unsuk Chin, Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf, and Michael Daugherty did not rise to prominence until late in the 20th century.For more examples see List of 21st-century classical composers.-- -- Electronic music  -- --

For centuries, instrumental music had either been created by singing, or using mechanical music technologies, such as drawing a bow across a string that is strung on a hollow instrument or plucking taut gut or metal strings (string instruments), constricting vibrating air (woodwinds and brass) or hitting something to make rhythmic sounds (percussion instruments).In the early twentieth century, electronic devices were invented that were capable of generating sound electronically, without an initial mechanical source of vibration.As early as the 1930s, composers such as Olivier Messiaen incorporated electronic instruments into live performance.While sound recording technology is often associated with the key role it played in enabling the creation and mass marketing of popular music, new electric and electronic sound recording technology was used to produce art music, as well.The musique concrète (French: “concrete music”), developed about 1948 by Pierre Schaeffer and his associates, was an experimental technique using recorded sounds as raw material.In the years following World War II, some composers were quick to adopt developing electronic technology.Electronic music was embraced by composers such as Edgard Varèse, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Milton Babbitt, Pierre Boulez, Bruno Maderna, Henri Pousseur, Karel Goeyvaerts, Ernst Krenek, Luigi Nono, Luciano Berio, Herbert Brün, and Iannis Xenakis.In the 1950s the film industry also began to make extensive use of electronic soundtracks.Major rock groups that were early adopters of synthesizers include The Moody Blues, The Beatles, The Monkees, and The Doors.-- -- Folk music  -- --

Folk music, in the original sense of the term as coined in the 18th century by Johann Gottfried Herder, is music produced by communal composition and possessing dignity, though by the late 19th century the concept of ‘folk’ had become a synonym for ‘nation’, usually identified as peasants and rural artisans, as in the Merrie England movement and the Irish and Scottish Gaelic Revivals of the 1880s.Folk music was normally shared and performed by the entire community (not by a special class of expert or professional performers, possibly excluding the idea of amateurs), and was transmitted by word of mouth (oral tradition).In addition, folk music was also borrowed by composers in other genres.Some of the work of Aaron Copland clearly draws on American folk music.An important work on registering traditional tunes of the Balkanic region was that of Béla Bartók since it is probably the first composer who was interested in recording audios as well as analysing them from an ethnological point of view.-- -- -- Bluegrass music  -- -- --

Bluegrass music is a form of American roots music, and a related genre of country music.Influenced by the music of Appalachia, Bluegrass has mixed roots in Irish, Scottish, Welsh,  and English traditional music, and was also later influenced by the music of African-Americans through incorporation of jazz elements.Settlers from the United Kingdom and Ireland arrived in Appalachia during the 18th century, and brought with them the musical traditions of their homelands.These traditions consisted primarily of English and Scottish ballads—which were essentially unaccompanied narrative—and dance music, such as Irish reels, which were accompanied by a fiddle.Many older bluegrass songs come directly from the British Isles.Several Appalachian bluegrass ballads, such as "Pretty Saro", "Barbara Allen", "Cuckoo Bird" and "House Carpenter", come from England and preserve the English ballad tradition both melodically and lyrically.Others, such as The Twa Sisters, also come from England; however, the lyrics are about Ireland.
==========
Some bluegrass fiddle songs popular in Appalachia, such as "Leather Britches", and "Pretty Polly", have Scottish roots.The dance tune Cumberland Gap may be derived from the tune that accompanies the Scottish ballad Bonnie George Campbell.Other songs have different names in different places; for instance in England there is an old ballad known as "A Brisk Young Sailor Courted Me", but exactly the same song in North American bluegrass is known as "I Wish My Baby Was Born".In bluegrass, as in some forms of jazz, one or more instruments each takes its turn playing the melody and improvising around it, while the others perform  accompaniment; this is especially typified in tunes called breakdowns.This is in contrast to old-time music, in which all instruments play the melody together or one instrument carries the lead throughout while the others provide accompaniment.Breakdowns are often characterized by rapid tempos and unusual instrumental dexterity and sometimes by complex chord changes.There are three major subgenres of bluegrass and one unofficial subgenre.Traditional bluegrass has musicians playing folk songs, tunes with simple traditional chord progressions, and using only acoustic instruments, with an example being Bill Monroe.Progressive bluegrass groups may use electric instruments and import songs from other genres, particularly rock & roll.Examples include Cadillac Sky and Bearfoot."Bluegrass gospel" has emerged as a third subgenre, which uses Christian lyrics, soulful three- or four-part harmony singing, and sometimes the playing of instrumentals.A newer development in the bluegrass world is Neo-traditional bluegrass; exemplified by bands such as The Grascals and Mountain Heart, bands from this subgenre typically have more than one lead singer.Bluegrass music has attracted a diverse following worldwide.Bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe characterized the genre as: "Scottish bagpipes and ole-time fiddlin'.It's Methodist and Holiness and Baptist.It's blues and jazz, and it has a high lonesome sound."-- -- Opera  -- --

In the early years of the century, Wagnerian chromatic harmony was extended by opera composers such as Richard Strauss (Salome, 1905; Elektra, 1906–1908; Der Rosenkavalier, 1910; Ariadne auf Naxos, 1912; Die Frau ohne Schatten, 1917), Claude Debussy (Pelléas et Mélisande, 1902), Giacomo Puccini (Madama Butterfly, 1904; La fanciulla del West, 1910; Il trittico, 1918), Ferruccio Busoni (Doktor Faust, 1916, posthumously completed by his student Philipp Jarnach), Béla Bartók (Bluebeard's Castle, 1911–17), Leos Janáček (Jenůfa, 1904; Osud, 1907; Kát´a Kabanová, 1919-1921) and Hans Pfitzner (Palestrina, 1917).Further extension of the chromatic language finally broke with tonality and moved into the style of atonal music in the early operas of Arnold Schoenberg (Erwartung, 1909; Die glückliche Hand, 1912) and his student Alban Berg (Wozzeck, 1925), both of whom adopted twelve-tone technique for their later operas: Schoenberg's Moses und Aron, and Berg’s Lulu.Neither of these operas were completed in their composers’ lifetimes, however, so that the first completed opera using the twelve-tone technique was Karl V (1938) by Ernst Krenek.Some of the most important operas of the twenties and thirties were composed by the Russian Dmitri Shostakovich (The Nose, 1928 and Ledi Makbet Mtsenkovo Uyezda [Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District], 1932).At the same time, the neoclassicism that became fashionable in the 1920s is represented by Stravinsky's opera buffa Mavra (1922) and his opera-oratorio Oedipus Rex (1927).Later in the century his last opera, The Rake's Progress (1951), also marks the end of the neoclassical phase of his compositions.Other operas of this period by composers identified as neoclassicists include Paul Hindemith's Mathis der Maler (1938), Sergei Prokofiev's Voina y Mir (War and Peace, 1941–1943), Bohuslav Martinu's Julietta aneb snár (1937) and Francis Poulenc's Les mamelles de Tirésias (1945).In the sixties, it should be noted, the Bernd Alois Zimmermann opera, Die Soldaten (1965), had a great impact.One of the most particular operas of the seventies was Le Grand Macabre, by György Ligeti.It deals with the subject of mortality through irony and collage.The most internationally accepted post–World War II composer of operas was Englishman Benjamin Britten (Peter Grimes, 1945; The Rape of Lucretia, 1946; Albert Herring, 1947; Billy Budd, 1951; Gloriana, 1953; The Turn of the Screw, 1954; A Midsummer Night's Dream, 1960; Owen Wingrave, 1970; Death in Venice, 1973)

The relationship (particularly, the relative value) of classical music and popular music is a controversial question.

8tracks.com is an internet radio and social networking website revolving around the concept of streaming user-curated playlists consisting of at least 8 tracks.Users create free accounts and can either browse the site and listen to other user-created mixes, and/or they can create their own mixes.The site also has a subscription-based service, 8 tracks plus, although its features are still evolving.Currently, a $25 payment purchases a 6-month subscription, during which time advertisements are removed from the website interface while subscribers are logged in.Specific DJ-focused features are in the works, but will likely include profile customization, mix analytics, and unlimited uploads.8tracks was recognized on Time magazine's 2011 incarnation of its "50 Best Websites" List.8tracks has also received positive press in Wired, CNET, and Business Insider.-- -- History  -- --
8tracks Founder David Porter claims his idea for a "music-oriented social network" has been in development since 1999 during his time in business school at Berkeley.However, this music-oriented social network was founded in 2006 and launched on August 8, 2008.One of Porter's major influences for the project was Napster, more specifically its "Hotlist" feature, which allowed users to add other users to their "hot list," consequently giving them access to that user's entire library.Also, after having spent 3 years prior to business school in London, Porter was fascinated by the social nature of the city's electronic music scene in which DJ's gained cult-like followings and augmented their following primarily through peer referral.Based on these concepts, Porter drafted a business plan entitled "Sampled & Sorted," which is now the name of his blog and was able to garner some initial attention for the project from venture capital firms.However, given his relative inexperience in the business world, Porter joined Live365, gained an understanding of their business model, their strengths and weaknesses, and was able to refine his original proposition.With the rise of Web 2.0, Porter finally decided to found 8tracks in the Fall of 2006, and after compiling a preliminary team, was able to launch the site on August 8, 2008.-- -- Usability  -- --
8tracks is a website that allows users to share and discover music in a simple, legal, and free way.Listeners are able to search through existing mixes and/or as create their personal mixes.Member must include a minimum of eight songs, uploaded from their personal music library or directly accessed from the 8tracks library, per playlist.Users can search for mixes by individual artist, specific genre, or by utilizing the "cloud" feature that sorts mixes by clickable, emotionally and/or psychographically descriptive tags (i.e.autumn, love, sad, eclectic).The songs in the playlist are revealed one at a time, similar to other internet radios, and listeners have three skips per playlist before they can "skip" onto a different mix, where their three skips are restored.Individual songs within a playlist each feature a direct link to iTunes should the user wish to purchase that song.Users can "like" entire mixes or "star" individual tracks within them in order to facilitate quick access in the future, and can also "follow" other users, effectively subscribing to the mixes they create.Users also have the ability to embed the mixes they create and share them through social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr.8tracks also has the ability to reverse sync with these social networking sites to allow users to easily find their "friends" and expand their network.8tracks also allows users to interact through smart phones.The iPhone App contains features similar to the web platform; users can "heart" mixes and "star" individual tracks and also purchase songs they like through iTunes.The Mix Feed gives users a stream of all their favorite tracks, and they can search for any artist of interest, or find mixes that include them.

8tracks follows specific programming rules that limits the number of songs that may be transmitted from any one album or any recording artist on a given channel or playlist.Negotiations to directly license music from participating independent record labels and artists who see promotional value in Internet radio.8tracks pays a royalty rate in two different ways.They first negotiate with representatives of copyright owners and then establish a pursuant to a proceeding conducted by the three judges on the Copyright Royalty Board.These musical works royalties are paid to ASCAP, BMI, and SECAC.This portion of revenue comprises 3% to 5% of total revenues.Reports to the copyright owners of each song used is transmitted on the service, pursuant to negotiate reporting requirements or requirements adopted by the Copyright Royalty Board.As a result, royalties may be fairly allocated and distributed to individual copyright owners and recording artists.-- -- Partnerships  -- --
8tracks has begun to offer their user-curated playlist platform to brands looking to open channels of communication with potential consumers through "music-centric interactive marketing" campaigns.For instance, apparel store/community Threadless partnered with 8tracks to host a monthly contest in which Threadless' warehouse crew judges playlists and the curator of their favorite mix wins a $50 gift certificate.To promote their new, retro Piiq headphones, Sony ran a contest in conjunction with fashion website Lookbook where users created mixes representative of "A Day in the Life (of You)" and those with the most likes won fashion and/or music-related prizes.Rolling Stone also added an interactive element to the release of its yearly "Playlist Issue" by compiling genre-specific celebrity- and artist-curated playlists that were hosted through the magazine's 8tracks user page and also embedded on the Rolling Stone website.This integrated media approach was significant in that it allowed otherwise heavily copyrighted music to be streamed legally.Notable curators included Tom Petty, Elton John, Art Garfunkel, Coldplay's Chris Martin, and Metallica's Lars Ulrich.Finally, California hotel chain Joie de Vivre and its partners offered a variety of prizes to DJs who published and generated the most likes on mixes driven by the theme of "California road trip" in order to drive brand awareness during the peak summer travel season.8tracks has partnered with Feature.fm to offer artists the ability to play their songs as "sponsored tracks" to people who are listening to playlists of the artist's style of music.-- -- Online radio  -- --
8tracks and other Internet radio sites, such as Pandora, allow users to explore a variety of songs and artists based on their musical preferences.

21st-century classical music is art music, in the contemporary classical tradition, that has been produced since the year 2000.Some elements of the previous century have been retained, including postmodernism, polystylism and eclecticism, which seek to incorporate elements of all styles of music irrespective of whether these are "classical" or not—these efforts represent a slackening differentiation between the various musical genres.Important influences include rock, pop, jazz and the dance traditions associated with these.The combination of classical music and multimedia is another notable practice in the 21st century; the Internet, alongside its related technology, are important resources in this respect.Attitudes towards female composers are also changing.-- -- Composition in the 21st century  -- --
Like the term 20th-century classical music, "21st-century classical music" is defined entirely by the calendar and does not refer to a historical style period in music—in the sense that Baroque and Romantic do—but rather to all art music produced since the year 2000.Musicologists generally say that we are in the contemporary music period—a term which covers art music written from around 1975 or 1945, depending on the historian's perspective.-- -- -- History  -- -- --
During the 20th century, composers started drawing on an ever wider range of sources for inspiration and developed a wide variety of techniques.Debussy became fascinated by the music of a Vietnamese theatre troupe and a Javanese gamelan ensemble and composers were increasingly influenced by the musics of other cultures.Schoenberg and the Second Viennese School developed the dodecaphonic system and serialism.Varèse, Stockhausen, and Xenakis helped pioneer electronic music.Jazz and the popular music of the West became increasingly important—both as influences on art music and as genres of their own.La Monte Young experimented with performance art; John Cage applied the I Ching to his music; Reich and Glass developed minimalism.Music generally became more and more diverse in style as the century progressed.This trend has continued into the 21st century: in 2009 BBC Music Magazine asked 10 composers, mostly British (John Adams, Julian Anderson, Henri Dutilleux, Brian Ferneyhough, Jonathan Harvey, James MacMillan, Michael Nyman, Roxanna Panufnik, Einojuhani Rautavaara, and John Tavener), to discuss the latest trends in western classical music.The consensus was that no particular style is favoured and that individuality is to be encouraged.The works of each of these composers represent different aspects of the music of this century but these composers all came to the same basic conclusion: music is too diverse to categorise or limit.In his interview with the magazine, Dutilleux argued that "there is only good or bad music, whether serious or popular".The music of the 21st century is mostly post-modernist, drawing on many different styles and open to a great many influences.Yet it is still a struggle to encourage the public to listen to contemporary music; indeed, this is true of Indian Classical Music, too.-- -- -- Musical styles and influence  -- -- --
Post-modernism continues to exert an influence on composers in the 21st century.Styles developed in the 20th century, such as minimalism (Philip Glass, Michael Nyman, Steve Reich), postminimalism (Louis Andriessen, Gavin Bryars, John McGuire, Pauline Oliveros (died 2016), Julia Wolfe), New Complexity (James Dillon, Brian Ferneyhough) and New Simplicity (Wolfgang Rihm) continue to be developed.Polystylism and musical eclecticism are growing trends in the 21st century.They combine elements of diverse musical genres and compositional techniques, often alien to the composers' own culture, into a unified and coherent body of works.Composers have often started their musical career in one discipline and have later migrated to or embraced others, while retaining important elements from the former discipline.In some cases, a composer now labelled "classical" may have started out in another discipline.For example, a specific label for John Zorn's music is difficult to choose: he started out as a performance artist and moved through various genres including jazz, hardcore punk, film music, and classical, and often embraces Jewish musical elements.All of these diverse styles appear in his works.Julian Anderson combines elements from many different musical genres and practices in his works.Elements of modernism, spectral music and electronic music are combined with elements of the folk music of Eastern Europe and the resulting works are often influenced by the modality of Indian ragas.His large-scale Book of Hours for 20 players and live electronics premiered in 2005.
==========
Tansy Davies's music also fuses elements of pop and classical music.Prince and Iannis Xenakis are both major influences.Kati Agócs' work for chorus and orchestra The Debrecen Passion (2015) surrounds settings of poetry by Szilárd Borbély with mystical texts of Medieval Latin, Hungarian, and Georgian origin, as well as a Kabalistic prayer.Composers are influenced from around the world.For example, in 2002, La Monte Young, along with Marian Zazeela, and senior disciple Jung Hee Choi founded the Just Alap Raga Ensemble which performs Indian classical music of the Kirana Gharana and merges the traditions of Western and Hindustani classical music, Young applying his own compositional approach to traditional raga performance, form, and technique.Other composers have also drawn upon diverse cultural and religious influences.For example, John Tavener (died 2013) drew his inspiration from eastern mysticism and the music of the Orthodox Church and James MacMillan is influenced by both traditional Scottish music and his own Roman Catholic faith.In a more abstract manner, religious and mystical associations are also found in the works of Sofia Gubaidulina, a devout member of the Russian Orthodox church.The influence of electronic music, numerology, unusual instrumentation and improvisational techniques are also apparent.Marxist songs serve as basic material for Konrad Boehmer in many works.Roman Turovsky-Savchuk is influenced by his Ukrainian heritage and Baroque music.He composes for the lute, orpharion and torban, and is an advocate of musical historicism and has collaborated with Hans Kockelmans and the New York Bandura Ensemble led by Julian Kytasty.Tan Dun, best known for his scores for the movies Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero, attempts to connect Buddhist, Christian and other cultures in his works.His works often incorporate audiovisual elementsComposers find inspiration from other sources, too.The music of John Luther Adams (an Alaskan environmentalist and no relation to the other John Adams discussed in this article) is informed by nature, especially that of his native Alaska.His Pulitzer Prize-winning symphony Become Ocean was inspired by climate change.Frank's House by Andrew Norman tries to evoke the architecture of Frank Gehry's house in Santa Monica.Péter Eötvös employs a variety of timbres and sound-worlds within his music.Extended techniques such as over-pressure bowings coexist with lyrical folk songs and synthesized sounds.Composers have even created mashups, more commonly found in pop music.Jeremy Sams' The Enchanted Island is one example: he draws from Handel, Vivaldi, Rameau, and other Baroque composers to create a combination of pasticcio and musical collage which also combines the baroque and the modern in its staging and costume.According to A History of Western Music, "it calls into question ideas of authorship and originality, making it a thoroughly postmodern work".The music of Osvaldo Golijov often combines the classical, modern and popular traditions within a single work juxtaposing contrasting styles—an important trend in the music of the 1960s onward.-- -- -- -- Opera  -- -- -- --
John Adams, George Benjamin, Osvaldo Golijov, Cristóbal Halffter, James MacMillan, Einojuhani Rautavaara (died 2016), Kaija Saariaho, Karlheinz Stockhausen (died 2007),  and Judith Weir have all made important contributions in this field:

Licht, Stockhausen's cycle of seven operas, begun in 1977, was completed in 2003 with the opera Sonntag aus Licht.Weir's opera Armida was premiered on television, rather than on stage.Channel 4 commissioned the work in 2005.The libretto, also written by Weir, updates Torquato Tasso's 1581 epic poem, La Gerusalemme liberata, setting it in a modern Middle-East conflict which alludes to but never specifically mentions the Iraq War.Weir's opera calls for props that could not be used practically in an opera house, such as a helicopter.Doctor Atomic by Adams (which covers Robert Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project, and the building of the first atomic bomb).Oppenheimer's aria Batter my heart blends post-minimalist techniques with an expressive vocal line recalling 19th-century opera.In October 2008, just before the premiere, Adams told BBC Radio 3 that he had been blacklisted by the U.S.Homeland Security department and immigration services, probably because of controversy surrounding his 1991 opera The Death of Klinghoffer, which was based on the hijacking of the passenger liner Achille Lauro by the Palestine Liberation Front in 1985 and the hijackers' murder of wheelchair-bound 69-year-old Jewish-American passenger Leon Klinghoffer.Saariaho's L'amour de loin uses her spectralist-influenced orchestral style to tell the story of 12th-century troubadour Jaufré Rudel.In the last tableau of Act IV, the modernist technique of cells based on arrays of semitones and tritones within perfect fifths is applied to the melodic material, while troubadour songs are evoked in the patterns of repeating phrases and the melodic style of short phrases focussed around certain pitches.Thus, 12th- and 20th-century musical ideas are fused in a unique manner.
==========
The Spanish composer Halffter wrote his second and third operas, Lazarus (2008) and Schachnovelle (2013), both for the Kiel Opera House.Golijov's Grammy-award winning Ainadamar (2005) is about the murder in 1936 of Spanish poet Federico García Lorca by the Fascists.The score combines computer music, musique concrète and modernist dissonance with elements from Flamenco music, Latin American popular music and Cuban rhythms.Written on Skin by Benjamin, The Sacrifice by MacMillan and Rasputin by Rautavaara are other representative works.Chamber opera is an important type of opera developed in the mid-twentieth century.They use smaller scale forces than regular operas.Examples from the 21st century include Pauline by Tobin Stokes (libretto by Margaret Atwood), The Corridor by Harrison Birtwistle, El Caballero de la triste figura by Tomás Marco and The Sound of a Voice by Philip Glass.-- -- -- -- Song and choral music  -- -- -- --
Adams' On the Transmigration of Souls (2002) is a choral piece commemorating the victims of the 11 September 2001 attacks (for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2003).Roxanna Panufnik's recent output includes The Song of Names and All Shall be Well.Golijov's La Pasión según San Marcos, Gubaidulina's Johannes-Passion, Tan Dun's Water Passion, and Wolfgang Rihm's Deus Passus were all composed for the Passion 2000 project, through which the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart commemorated the 250th anniversary of the death of J.S.Bach.Golijov, being a Jew and Latin American, offered a different perspective on the Passion: he drew on African-influenced traditions from Cuba and Brazil, flamenco and Baroque music to create a work that enacts the story as a ritual through voices, dance and movement.Henri Dutilleux's last works (died 2013) include Correspondances and Le temps l'horloge, both of which are song cycles.-- -- -- -- Orchestral works  -- -- -- --
Arvo Pärt's Symphony No.4, Los Angeles is the first of his symphonies to be written post-1976 and is the first of his pieces to focus on larger scale, instrumental tintinnabulation.Oliver Knussen's Violin Concerto, Op.30, written for Pinchas Zukerman, premièred in 2003.Jennifer Higdon's blue cathedral, premièred in 2000, is a one-movement orchestral tone-poem and is ranked among the most widely performed works of the early 21st century.It was written in memory of her brother and features flute (her instrument) and clarinet (his instrument) in dialogue in their upper registers.The work evokes Debussy's more accessible form of modernism: parallel triads in strings and brass; changes in pitch set demarcating musical units, such as phrases, and providing a sense of harmonic progression; and Debussy's distinctive orchestral colour.Samuel Adler's compositions for orchestra from this century include: A Bridge to Understanding (2008), All Nature Plays (2009), Drifting on Winds and Currents (2010), and In the Spirit of Bach (2014).Jonathan Harvey's Body Mandala (2006) and Speakings (2008), Anna Clyne's Night Ferry, Elliott Carter's Three Illusions for Orchestra, Christopher Theofanidis' Rainbow Body, Peter Maxwell Davies's Eighth (2001), Ninth (2012), and Tenth (2013) Symphonies, and Per Nørgård's Seventh (2006) and Eighth (2011) Symphonies are just some of the other important orchestral works produced this century.-- -- -- -- Chamber and instrumental music  -- -- -- --
Elliott Carter (died 2012) has written a large body of music for chamber groups and soloist since 2000.These include Tintinnabulation for percussion sextet, Double Trio for trumpet, trombone, percussion, piano, violin and cello, a string trio, Hiyoku for two clarinets, as well as several new pieces in his Retracing and Figment series for soloists and Two Thoughts about the Piano.His Caténaires for solo piano (2006) evokes both the texture of the finale of Chopin's B♭ minor Sonata and 20th-century serialism.Stockhausen's last major work, the unfinished cycle of twenty-four compositions collectively titled Klang, is predominantly made up of chamber-music pieces.Notable string quartets composed since 2000 include: 

the quartet by Hanspeter Kyburz
the Sixth (2002), Seventh ("Espacio de silencio", 2007), Eighth ("Ausencias", 2013), and Ninth ("In memoriam Miguel de Cervantes", 2016) Quartets by Cristóbal Halffter
two numbered quartets—the Fifth (2006) and Sixth (2009)—and Dum transisset I–IV (2007), Exordium (2008), and Silentium (2014) by Brian Ferneyhough
the series of ten Naxos Quartets (2001–07) by Peter Maxwell Davies.At his death in 2016, Davies also left an unfinished final String Quartet, Op.338, of which only the first movement was completed.The German composer Wolfgang Rihm extended his list of string quartets, first with the Twelfth Quartet (2001), the brief Fetzen 2 (2002), and a Quartettstudie (2003–04), then with a revised version of String Quartet No.11 (2010) and the Thirteenth Quartet (2011), as well as another short work, In Verbundenheit (2014).Austrian Georg Friedrich Haas has written a Third ("In iij.Noct.", 2003) and Fourth String Quartet (2003), and the Hungarian composer György Kurtág has also extended his series of (unnumbered) works for this medium, with Six Moments Musicaux (1999–2005), Hommage à Jacob Obrecht (2004–2005), and—in collaboration with György Kurtág junior—Zwiegespräch for string quartet and electronics (1999–2006).-- -- -- -- Electronic music  -- -- -- --
Electronic, electroacoustic, and computer music, pioneered in the 20th century, continue to develop in the 21st century.One of the major figures in the early development of electronic music, Karlheinz Stockhausen, composed his last electronic works—Cosmic Pulses and eight further pieces derived from it—as hours 13 to 21 of his Klang cycle (2005–2007).Mario Davidovsky has extended his series Synchronisms, which in live performance incorporate both acoustic instruments and electroacoustic sounds played from a tape.Other composers including Mason Bates, Jean-Claude Éloy, Rolf Gehlhaar, Jon Hassell, York Höller, Hanspeter Kyburz, Mesías Maiguashca, Philippe Manoury, and Gérard Pape are active is this field.

An academic degree is a qualification awarded to students upon successful completion of a course of study in higher education, usually at a college or university.These institutions commonly offer degrees at various levels, usually including bachelor's, master’s and doctorates, often alongside other academic certificates and professional degrees.The most common undergraduate degree is the bachelor's degree, although in some countries there are lower level higher education qualifications that are also titled degrees (e.g.associate degrees and foundation degrees).-- -- History  -- --


 -- -- -- Emergence of the doctor’s and master’s degrees and the licentiate  -- -- --
The doctorate (Latin: doceo “I teach”) appeared in medieval Europe as a license to teach (Latin: licentia docendi) at a medieval university.Its roots can be traced to the early church when the term "doctor" referred to the Apostles, church fathers and other Christian authorities who taught and interpreted the Bible.The right to grant a licentia docendi was originally reserved to the church which required the applicant to pass a test, to take oath of allegiance and pay a fee.The Third Council of the Lateran of 1179 guaranteed the access – now largely free of charge – of all able applicants, who were, however, still tested for aptitude by the ecclesiastic scholastic.This right remained a bone of contention between the church authorities and the slowly emancipating universities, but was granted by the Pope to the University of Paris in 1231 where it became a universal license to teach (licentia ubique docendi).However, while the licentia continued to hold a higher prestige than the bachelor's degree (Baccalaureus), it was ultimately reduced to an intermediate step to the Magister and doctorate, both of which now became the exclusive qualification for teaching.At the University, doctoral training was a form of apprenticeship to a guild.The traditional term of study before new teachers were admitted to the guild of "Master of Arts", seven years, was the same as the term of apprenticeship for other occupations.Originally the terms "master" and "doctor" were synonymous, but over time the doctorate came to be regarded as a higher qualification than the master degree.Today the terms "master", "Doctor" (from the Latin – meaning literally: "teacher") and "Professor" signify different levels of academic achievement, but in the Medieval university they were equivalent terms, the use of them in the degree name being a matter of custom at a university.(Most universities conferred the Master of Arts, although the highest degree was often termed Master of Theology/Divinity or Doctor of Theology/Divinity depending on the place).The earliest doctoral degrees (theology – Divinitatis Doctor (D.D.), law – Legum Doctor (LL.D., later D.C.L.)and medicine – Medicinæ Doctor (M.D., D.M.))reflected the historical separation of all higher University study into these three fields.Over time, the D.D.has gradually become less common outside theology and is now mostly used for honorary degrees, with the title "Doctor of Theology" being used more often for earned degrees.Studies outside theology, law and medicine were then called "philosophy", due to the Renaissance conviction that real knowledge could be derived from empirical observation.The degree title of Doctor of Philosophy is a much later time and was not introduced in England before 1900.Studies in what once was called philosophy are now classified as sciences and humanities.The University of Bologna in Italy, regarded as the oldest university in Europe, was the first institution to confer the degree of Doctor in Civil Law in the late 12th century; it also conferred similar degrees in other subjects, including medicine.The University of Paris used the term "master" for its graduates, a practice adopted by the English universities of Oxford and Cambridge, as well as the ancient Scottish universities of St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh.-- -- -- Emergence of the bachelor's degree  -- -- --
In the medieval European universities, candidates who had completed three or four years of study in the prescribed texts of the trivium (grammar, rhetoric and logic) and the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music), together known as the Liberal Arts and who had successfully passed examinations held by their master, would be admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Arts, from the Latin baccalaureus, a term previously used of a squire (i.e., apprentice) to a knight.Further study and in particular successful participation in and then moderating of disputations would earn one the Master of Arts degree, from the Latin magister, "master" (typically indicating a teacher), entitling one to teach these subjects.Masters of Arts were eligible to enter study under the "higher faculties" of Law, Medicine or Theology and earn first a bachelor's and then master or doctor's degrees in these subjects.Thus a degree was only a step on the way to becoming a fully qualified master – hence the English word "graduate", which is based on the Latin gradus ("step").-- -- -- The evolution of the terminology of degrees  -- -- --
The naming of degrees eventually became linked with the subjects studied.Scholars in the faculties of arts or grammar became known as "master", but those in theology, medicine and law were known as "doctor".
==========
As study in the arts or in grammar was a necessary prerequisite to study in subjects such as theology, medicine and law, the degree of doctor assumed a higher status than the master degree.This led to the modern hierarchy in which the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), which in its present form as a degree based on research and dissertation is a development from 18th- and 19th-century German universities, is a more advanced degree than the Master of Arts (M.A.).The practice of using the term doctor for PhDs developed within German universities and spread across the academic world.The French terminology is tied closely to the original meanings of the terms.The baccalauréat (cf."bachelor") is conferred upon French students who have successfully completed their secondary education and admits the student to university.When students graduate from university, they are awarded licence, much as the medieval teaching guilds would have done and they are qualified to teach in secondary schools or proceed to higher-level studies.Spain had a similar structure: the term "Bachiller" was used for those who finished the secondary or high-school level education, known as "Bachillerato".The standard Spanish university 5-years degree was "Licenciado", (although there were a few 3-years associate degrees called "diplomaturas", from where the "diplomados" could move to study a related licenciatura).The highest level was "Doctor".-- -- -- Degrees awarded by institutions other than universities  -- -- --
In the past, degrees have also been directly issued by authority of the monarch or by a bishop, rather than any educational institution.This practice has mostly died out.In Great Britain, Lambeth Degrees are still awarded by the Archbishop of Canterbury.The Archbishop of Canterbury's right to grant degrees is derived from Peter's Pence Act of 1533 which empowered the Archbishop to grant dispensations previously granted by the Pope.Among educational institutions, St David's College, Lampeter was granted limited degree awarding powers by royal charter in the nineteenth century, despite not being a university.University College North Staffordshire was also granted degree awarding powers on its foundation in 1949, despite not becoming a university (as the University of Keele) until 1962.Following the Education Reform Act 1988, many educational institutions other than universities have been granted degree awarding powers, including higher education colleges and colleges of the University of London (many of which are now effectively universities in their own right).-- -- -- Academic dress  -- -- --

In most countries, gaining an academic degree entitles the holder to assume distinctive academic dress particular to the awarding institution, identifying the status of the individual wearing them.-- -- Laws on granting and use of degrees  -- --

In many countries degrees may only be awarded by institutions authorised to do so by the national or regional government.Frequently governments will also regulate the use of university in names of businesses.This approach is followed, for example, by Australia and the United Kingdom.The use of fake degrees by individuals, either obtained from a bogus institution or simply invented, is often covered by fraud laws.-- -- Indicating earned degrees  -- --
Depending on culture and the degree earned, degrees may be indicated by a pre-nominal title, post-nominal letters, a choice of either or not indicated at all.In countries influenced by the UK, post-nominal letters are the norm, with only doctorates granting a title, while titles are the norm in many northern European countries.Depending on the culture and the purpose of the listing, only the highest degree, a selection of degrees or all degrees might be listed.The awarding institution may also be shown and it might be specified if a degree was at honours level, particularly where the honours degree is a separate qualification from the ordinary bachelor's degree.For member institutions of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, there is a standard list of abbreviations for university names given in the Commonwealth Universities Yearbook, but in practice many variations are used and the Yearbook notes that the abbreviations used may not match those used by the universities concerned.For some British universities it is traditional to use Latin abbreviations, notably 'Oxon' and 'Cantab' for the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge respectively, in spite of these having been superseded by English 'Oxf' and 'Camb' in official university usage, particularly in order to distinguish the Oxbridge MA from an earned MA.Other Latin abbreviations commonly used include 'Cantuar' for Lambeth degrees (awarded by the Archbishop of Canterbury), 'Dunelm' for Durham University, 'Ebor' for the University of York and 'Exon' for the University of Exeter.The Ancient universities of Scotland and the University of London have abbreviations that are the same in English and Latin.(See Universities in the United Kingdom § Post-nominal abbreviations for a more complete list and discussion of abbreviations for British universities.)Confusion can result from universities sharing similar names, e.g.
==========
the University of York in the UK and York University in Canada or Newcastle University in the UK and the University of Newcastle in Australia.In this case, the convention is to include a country abbreviation with the university's name.For example, 'York (Can.)'and 'York (UK)' or 'Newc (UK)' and 'Newc (Aus.)are commonly used to denote degrees conferred by these universities where the potential for confusion exists, and institution names are given in this form in the Commonwealth Universities Yearbook.Abbreviations used for degrees vary between countries and institutions, e.g.MS indicates Master of Science in the US and places following American usage, but Master of Surgery in the UK and most Commonwealth countries, where the standard abbreviation for Master of Science is MSc.Common abbreviations include BA and MA for Bachelor and Master of Arts, BS/BSc and MS/MSc for Bachelor and Master of Science, MD for Doctor of Medicine and PhD for Doctor of Philosophy.-- -- Online degree  -- --

An online degree is an academic degree (usually a college degree, but sometimes the term includes high school diplomas and non-degree certificate programs) that can be earned primarily or entirely on a distance learning basis through the use of an Internet-connected computer, rather than attending college in a traditional campus setting.Improvements in technology, the increasing use of the Internet worldwide and the need for people to have flexible school schedules that enable them to work while attending school have led to a proliferation of online colleges that award associate's, bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees.-- -- Degree systems by regions  -- --


 -- -- -- Asia  -- -- --


 -- -- -- -- Bangladesh, India and Pakistan  -- -- -- --
Bangladesh, India and Pakistan mostly follow the colonial era British system for classification of degrees.The arts, referring to the performing arts and literature, have the corresponding degrees: Bachelor of Arts (BA) and the Master of Arts (MA).Management degrees are also classified under 'Arts' but is nowadays considered a major new stream, Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) and Master Of Business Administration (MBA).Science referring to the basic sciences and natural science (Biology, Physics, Chemistry etc.)the corresponding degree are Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.)and its master is called Master of Science (M.Sc.).Another new set of Information Technology degree conferred specially in the field of computer science, Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (B.Sc.IT.)and Master of Science in Information Technology (M.Sc.IT.).The engineering degree in India follows two nomenclatures, Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.)and Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.).Both represent bachelor's degree in engineering.In Pakistan, engineering degrees are Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.)and Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S./B.Sc.Engineering).Both are same in curriculum, duration and pattern and differs only in nomenclature where as B.Tech.degree holders are considered as engineering technologists in Pakistan.The engineering degree in Bangladesh is Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.Sc.Engineering).Medical Degree – Bachelor of Medicine & Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS), Dental Degree – Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS), Computer Application Degree – Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA) and Master of Computer Application (MCA).-- -- -- -- Sri Lanka  -- -- -- --

Grading in Tunisia is done on a scale of 0-20.The passing grade is 10 out of 20 which is 50% of the complete mark; 20.This grading system is used from middle-school up to university level.A PhD thesis is even graded out of 20.To get ahead on the academic ladder, one is strictly assessed numerically.That is; if you are a BA holder applying for an MA program you will be admitted according to how high your grades were during your undergraduate years.Level 4 courses come in the form of 1st year of a bachelors programme or HNC (Higher National Certificate).Depending on the Type of associate degree a student may be able to start their 2nd year of bachelors (The course must be the same as the one they are applying for)


 -- -- -- Europe  -- -- --

Since the Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education in the European Region in 1997 and the Bologna declaration in 1999, higher education systems in Europe are being harmonised through the Bologna process, based on a three-cycle hierarchy of degrees: Bachelor's/Licence –  Master's – Doctorate, with the later addition of a "short cycle (within the first cycle)" to cover sub-bachelor's qualifications.This system is gradually replacing the two-stage system previously used in some countries and is combined with other elements such as the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) and the use of Diploma Supplements to make comparisons between qualifications easier.The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) was formally established in 2010 and as of September 2016 has 50 members.Implementation of the various elements of the EHEA varies.Twenty-four countries have fully implemented a national qualifications framework and a further ten have a framework but have not yet certified it against the overarching framework; in 38 countries ECTS credits are used for all higher education programmes; 31 countries have fully implemented diploma supplements; and only 11 countries have included all the major points of the Lisbon Recognition Convention in national legislation.From 2008, the European Union has been developing the European Qualifications Framework (EQF).This is an eight-level framework designed to allow cross-referencing of the various national qualifications frameworks.While it is not specific to higher education, the top four levels (5–8) correspond to the short cycle, first cycle, second cycle and third cycle of the EHEA.-- -- -- -- Austria  -- -- -- --
In Austria, there are currently two parallel systems of academic degrees:

the traditional two-cycle system of Magister/Diplom followed by the Doctorate and
the three-cycle system of Bachelor, Master and Doctorate as defined by the Bologna process.With a few exceptions, the two-cycle degree system will be phased out by 2010.Some of the established degree naming has, however, been preserved, allowing universities to award the "Diplom-Ingenieur" (and for a while also the "Magister") to graduates of the new-style Master programmes.-- -- -- -- Czech Republic  -- -- -- --
The Czech Republic implemented Bologna process so there are basically three degrees: Bachelor (3 years), Master (2 years after Bachelor) and Doctor (3 years after Master).There are also voluntary academic titles called "small doctorates" (e. g. RNDr.for natural sciences, PhDr.for philosophy, JUDr.for law etc.)achieved after rigorosum exam.Medical students don't get bachelor's or master's degrees, instead they study six years and after obligatory rigorous exam they get title MUDr.(equivalent to MD degree) or MDDr.for dentists or MVDr.for veterinary physicians.They can also get "big doctorate" (Ph.D.) after another three or (more often) four years of studies.Bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and small doctorates in the form of shortcuts (Bc., Mgr., Ing., ...) are listed before name of person, Doctor degree (Ph.D.) is listed after name (e. g. MUDr.Jan Novák, Ph.D.).There are more degrees that used to be awarded, but you can still encounter them.
==========
Czechs are very proud of their academic degrees and titles therefore its omission is considered disrespectful.-- -- -- -- Denmark  -- -- -- --

Before the adaptation to international standards, the lowest degree that would normally be studied at universities in Denmark was equivalent to a master's degree (kandidatgrad).Officially, bachelor's degrees was always obtained after 3 years' university studies.Various medium-length (2–4 years) professional degrees have been adapted so they now have status as professional bachelor's degrees of varying length and opposed to academic bachelor's degrees they are considered to be "applied" degrees.A professional bachelor's degree is 180 or 210 or 240 ECTS-points.The academic degrees available at universities are:
bachelor i <field of study> (bachelor's degree  -- 180 ECTS-points)
cand.<Latin abbreviation of field of study> (master's degree  -- 120 ECTS-points, except Medicine, which is 180 ECTS-points and Veterinary Medicine, which is 150 ECTS-points)
ph.d. (PhD degree  -- normally 180 ECTS-points)
dr. <Latin abbreviation of field of study> (higher doctoral degree  -- normally after a minimum of 5 years of individual and original research)


 -- -- -- -- Finland  -- -- -- --
Historically, the Finnish higher education system is derived from the German system.The current system of higher education comprises two types of higher education institutions, the universities and the polytechnics, many of whom refer to themselves as Universities of Applied Sciences (UAS) With the exception of few fields such as Medicine and Dentistry, the Finnish system of Higher education degrees is in compliance with the Bologna process.Universities award bachelor's degrees (kandidaatti / kandidat), Master's degrees (maisteri / magister) and doctoral degrees (lisensiaatin tutkinto / licentiat examen and tohtorin tutkinto / doktorexamen).In most fields the system of doctoral degrees is two-tier, the degree of Licentiate is an independent academic degree but completing the degree of Doctor does not require completion of a Licentiate degree.The Polytechnics (Universities of Applied Sciences) have the right to award bachelor's and master's degrees, the degree titles of are distinct from the titles used for university degrees.In general, students who are admitted to bachelor studies at a university have the right to continue to studies at master level.At polytechnics, the right to continue to master-level studies has to be applied for separately and there is also a work experience requirement.The majority of master's degree holders have graduated from university.The degrees awarded by the universities and polytechnics are at par by law, but the content and orientation of studies is different.A master's degree obtained at a polytechnic gives the same academic right to continue studies at Doctoral level as a master's degree obtained at a university.-- -- -- -- France  -- -- -- --
The French national education system makes a distinction between a diplôme national ("national degree") and diplôme universitaire ("university degree").The former, which are considered higher status, are controlled by the state and issued by universities on behalf of the responsible ministry; the latter are controlled and granted by the universities themselves.Additionally, private providers may be recognised by the state and then, after five years of recognition, have their degrees validated by the state, the validation having to be renewed every six years.Historically, academic degrees were orientated towards research and the vocational education system awarded only diplomas.Since the implementation of the Bologna Process in France, things are going towards a simplification: schools continue to deliver their own diplomas, but the State recognition and degree awarding is far more ranged than before.Diploma courses such as the Technological University Diploma (diplôme universitaire de technologie; DUT) and the Technologist's Certificate (brevet de technician supérieur; BTS) are now recognised as "short cycle" qualifications worth 120 ECTS credits, allowing progression from these to academic qualifications.Nonetheless, there are diplomas in France with no degree recognition, e.g.specific diplomas designed by various institutions with no recognition from the Ministry of Education, such as the mastère spécialisé or the Sciences Po Bachelor.The recognised degrees fall in three levels, following the Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area.These are the licence (first cycle), master (second cycle) and doctorat (third cycle).All licence degrees are 3 years (180 ECTS credits) in length and all master's degrees are 2 years (120 ECTS credits) in length.There are also 5 year (300 ECTS credits) engineer's degrees, which are master's degree.In addition to the doctorate, which is always a research degree, the Diplôme d'Etat de docteur en médicine and the Diplôme d'Etat de docteur vétérinaire are also considered third cycle qualifications.-- -- -- -- Germany  -- -- -- --
Traditionally in Germany, students graduated after four to six years either with a Magister degree in Social Sciences, Humanities, Linguistics and the Arts or with a Diplom degree in Natural Sciences, Economics, Business Administration, Political Science, Sociology, Theology and Engineering.Those degrees were the first and at the same time highest non-PhD/Doctorate-title in many disciplines before its gradual replacement by other Anglo-Saxon-inspired master's and bachelor's degrees under the Bologna process.
==========
The Magister and Diplom awarded by universities, both of which require a final thesis, are considered equivalent to a master's degree, although the Diplom awarded by a Fachhochschule (university of applied sciences) is at bachelor's degree level.A special kind of examination is the Staatsexamen (State Examination).It is not an academic degree but a government licensing examination that future doctors, dentists, teachers, lawyers (solicitors), judges, public prosecutors, patent attorneys and pharmacists have to pass in order to be eligible to work in their profession.Students usually study at university for three to six year, depending on the field, before they take the first Staatsexamen.While this is normally at master's level, a few courses (e.g.primary and lower secondary level teaching), which have a standard study period of three years, are assigned to bachelor's level.After the first Staatsexamen, teachers and lawyers go through a form of pupillage, the Vorbereitungsdienst, for two years, before they are able to take the second Staatsexamen, which tests their practical abilities in their jobs.At some institutions pharmacists and jurists can choose whether to be awarded the first Staatsexamen or a master's degree (or formerly the Diplom).Since 1999, the traditional degrees have been replaced by bachelor's (Bachelor) and master's (Master) degrees as part of the Bologna process.The main reasons for this change are to make degrees internationally comparable and to introduce degrees to the German system which take less time to complete (German students typically took five years or more to earn a Magister or Diplom).Some universities were initially resistant to this change, considering it a displacement of a venerable tradition for the pure sake of globalization.However, universities had to fulfill the new standard by the end of 2007.Enrollment into Diplom and Magister programs is no longer possible.However, programs leading to Staatsexamen did usually not make the transition to Bologna degrees.Doctorates are issued with various designations, depending on the faculty: e.g., Doktor der Naturwissenschaften (Doctor of Natural Science); Doktor der Rechtswissenschaften (Doctor of Law); Doktor der Medizin (Doctor of Medicine); Doktor der Philosophie (Doctor of Philosophy), to name just a few.Multiple doctorates and honorary doctorates are often listed and even used in forms of address in German-speaking countries.A Diplom, Magister, Master's or Staatsexamen student can proceed to a doctorate.Well qualified bachelor's graduates can also enrol directly into PhD programs after a procedure to determine their aptitude administered by the admitting university.The doctoral degree (e.g., Dr. rer.nat., Dr. phil.and others) is the highest academic degree in Germany and generally a research degree.The degree Dr. med.for medical doctors has to be viewed differently; medical students usually write their doctoral theses right after they have completed studies, without any previous conducted scientific research, just as students in other disciplines write a Diplom, Magister or Master's thesis.Higher doctorates, such as the D.Sc.degree in the UK, are not present in the German system.However, sometimes incorrectly regarded as a degree, the Habilitation is a higher academic qualification in Germany, Austria and Switzerland that allows further teaching and research endorsement after a doctorate.It is earned by writing a second thesis (the Habilitationsschrift) or presenting a portfolio of first-author publications in an advanced topic.The exact requirements for satisfying a Habilitation depend on individual universities.The "habil.", as it is abbreviated to represent that a habilitation has been awarded after the doctorate, was traditionally the conventional qualification for serving at least as a Privatdozent (e.g."PD Dr.

habil.")(Senior Lecturer) in an academic professorship.Some German universities no longer require the Habilitation, although preference may still be given to applicants who have this credential, for academic posts in the more traditional fields.-- -- -- -- Ireland  -- -- -- --
Ireland operates under a National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).The school leaving qualification attained by students is called the Leaving Certificate.It is considered Level 4-5 on the framework.This qualification is the traditional route of entry into third level education.There are also Level 5 qualifications in certain vocational subjects (e.g.Level 5 Certificate in Restaurant Operations) awarded by the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC).Advanced Certificates at level 6 are also awarded by FETAC.The Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) award the following:
A higher certificate at Level 6;
An ordinary bachelor's degree at Level 7;
An honours bachelor's degree or higher diploma at Level 8;
A master's degree or postgraduate diploma at Level 9;
A doctoral degree or higher doctorate at level 10.These are completed in institutes of technology or universities.-- -- -- -- Italy  -- -- -- --

In Italy access to university is possible after gaining the Diploma di Maturità at 19 years of age, following 5 years of study in a specific high school focused on certain subjects (e.g.liceo classico focused on classical subjects, including philosophy, ancient Greek and Latin; liceo scientifico focused on scientific subjects such as Maths, Chemistry, Biology and Physics but also including philosophy, ancient Latin and Italian Literature; liceo linguistico focused on Foreign Languages and Literature; istituto tecnico focused on practical and theoretical subjects such as Mechanics, Aerospace, Shipbuilding, Electronics, Computer science, Telecommunications, Chemistry, Biology, Fashion industry, Food industry, Building technology, Law and Economy).After gaining the diploma one can enter university and enrol in any curriculum (e.g.physics, medicine, chemistry, engineering, architecture): all high school diplomas allow access to any university curriculum, although most universities have pre-admission tests.In 2011, Italy introduced a qualifications framework, known as the Quadro dei Titoli Italiani (QTI), tied to the three cycles of the Bologna Process.This tied together in a three-level system both the new qualifications introduced as part of the Bologna process and the older, pre-Bologna qualifications and covers qualifications from university institutions and higher education institutions for fine arts, music and dance (AFAM institutions).In addition to academic degrees, many professional qualifications are tied to the QTI at the different levels.The first level, tied to the first cycle of the Bologna Process, covers the laurea (bachelor's degree) in universities and the Diploma accademico di primo livello in AFAM institutions.The older qualifications mapped to this level are the Diploma universitario and the Diploma di scuole dirette a fini speciali (SDAFS) from universities and the Diploma di Conservatorio, Diploma di Istituto Musicale Pareggiato, Diploma dell'Accademia di Belle Arti, Diploma dell'Istituto Superiore delle Industrie Artistiche (ISIA), Diploma dell'Accademia Nazionale di Danza and Diploma dell'Accademia Nazionale di Arte Drammatica from AFAM institutions.The laurea is obtained after three years of study (180 ECTS credits) and gives the academic title of dottore; the older university qualifications at this level took two to three years, with three year courses granting the title of dottore.The second level, tied to the second cycle of the Bologna Process, covers the Laurea magistrale and the laurea specialistica in university institutions and the Diploma accademico di secondo livello in AFAM institutions.The old Diploma di laurea is mapped to this level.The Laurea magistrale and the laurea specialistica are obtained after two further years of study (120 ECTS credits) and give the academic title of dottore magistrale.The old Diploma di laurea took four to six years but was accessed directly from school, with a possible reduction by one year for those with a related diploma and also granted the title of dottore magistrale.The third level, tied to the third cycle of the Bologna Process, covers the Dottorato di ricerca in university institutions and the Diploma accademico di formazione alla ricerca in AFAM institutions.The old Dottorato di ricerca and Diploma di specializzazione are tied to this level.The Dottorato di ricerca, under both new and old systems, takes a minimum of three years after the laurea magistralie/specialistica and gives the academic titles of Dottore di Ricerca (Dott.Ric.)and PhD.The old Diploma di specializzazione took two to six years and gave the academic title of Specialista.Universities in Italy offer a number of other qualifications including the Master universitario di primo livello (1 year/60 ECTS credits, 2nd cycle qualification) and the Master universitario di secondo livello (1 year/60 ECTS credits, 3rd cycle qualification), following on from the laurea and the laurea magistrale/specialistica respectively.These do not give access to the PhD.
==========
The Diploma di specializzazione, which is offered in a few specific professions, takes two to six years and gives the title of specialista.The Diploma di perfezionamento is a university certificate, aimed at professional training or in specific study fields, which usually takes one year; it is not allocated a level on the framework.AFAM institutions may offer Diploma di perfezionamento o Master and Diploma accademico di specializzazione.These are one year and two year qualifications respectively and may be offered at second cycle or third cycle level, distinguished by adding (I) or (II) after the qualification name.Higher Schools for Language Mediators offer the Diploma di mediatore linguistico, a first cycle degree taking three years (180 ECTS credits), which gives access to the laurea specialistica.Specialisation Institutes/Schools in Psychoterapy offer the Diploma di specializzazione in psicoterapia, a third cycle qualification taking at least four years and requiring a laurea magistrale/specialistica in either Psychology or Medicine and Surgery, along with professional registration.-- -- -- -- Netherlands  -- -- -- --

In the Netherlands, the structure of academic studies was altered significantly in 1982 when the "Tweefasenstructuur" (Two Phase Structure) was introduced by the Dutch Minister of Education, Wim Deetman.With this two phase structure an attempt was made to standardise all the different studies and structure them to an identical timetable.Additional effect was that students would be persuaded stringently to produce results within a preset time-frame or otherwise discontinue their studies.The two phase structure has been adapted to a bachelor-master structure as a result of the Bologna process.-- -- -- -- -- Admission  -- -- -- -- --
In order for a Dutch student to get access to a university education, the student must complete a six-year pre-university secondary education called "voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs" (vwo).There are other routes possible, but only if the end level of the applicant is comparable to the two levels is access to university education is granted.For some studies, specific end levels or disciplines are required, e.g., graduating without physics, biology and chemistry will make it impossible to study medicine.People 21 years old or older who do not have the required entrance diplomas may opt for an entrance exam for being admitted to a higher education curriculum.In this exam, they have to prove their command of disciplines considered necessary for pursuing such study.After September 1, 2002 they would be thus admitted to a Bachelor's curriculum, not to a Master's curriculum.For some studies in the Netherlands, a governmental determined limited access is in place (although under political review for abolishment, February 2011).This is a limitation of the number of applicants to a specific study, thus trying to control the eventual number of graduates.The most renowned studies for their numerus clausus are medicine and dentistry.Every year a combination of the highest pre-university graduation grades and some additional conditions determine who can start such a numerus clausus study and who can not.Almost all Dutch universities are government supported universities, with only very few privately owned universities in existence (i.e.one in business and all others in theology).Leiden University is the oldest, founded in 1575.-- -- -- -- -- Pre-Bologna phases  -- -- -- -- --
Before the introduction of the bachelor-master structure, almost all academic studies in the Netherlands had the same length of four years and had two phases:

The "propedeutische fase" (1–2 years): After finishing this phase a student can follow another two years' study, which grants equivalents to the Anglo-Saxon BSc (Bachelor of Science), BA (Bachelor of Arts) or LLB (Bachelor of Laws).The "doctorale fase" (3–4 years): Completing the first phase successfully gives the student access to the second phase.Again, failure to finish within the time given will lead to discontinuation.This phase is concluded with the "doctoraal examen" (doctoral exam).This is not similar to any type of doctoral exam that would grant the student with any type of PhD title.Successful completion however does grant the student the Dutch degree of "drs.""doctorandus", ir.("ingenieur" – engineer) or "mr." ("Meester in de rechten" - master of law).
==========
Nowadays these Dutch titles have been largely replaced by the Anglo Saxon titles MSc (Master of Science), MA (Master of Arts) and LLM (Master of Laws), depending on the area of study.For medical students the "doctorandus" degree is not equivalent to the European Anglo Saxon postgraduate research degree in medicine of MD (Medical Doctor).Besides the title doctorandus, the graduates of the Curius curriculum may also bear the title arts (physician).The doctorandus in medicine title is granted after four years (nominal time) of the Curius curriculum, while the title physician is granted after six years (nominal time) of that curriculum.The Dutch physician title is equal to a MSc degree according to the Bologna process and can be compared with the MBBS in the UK degree system and the North American MD, but not the UK MD degree, which is a research degree.One-on-one equivalence or interchangeability of the Dutch medical title and MD is often suggested.However, officially the MD title is not known, nor legal to use in the Netherlands.The correct notation for a Dutch physician who completed his or her medical studies, but did not pursue a doctor (PhD-like) study is "drs."(e.g.drs.Jansen, arts) and not "dr." in medicine, as often used incorrectly.However, like in the United Kingdom, physicians holding these degrees are referred to as 'Doctor' by courtesy.In the Netherlands, there is the informal title dokter for physicians, but not doctor (dr.), unless they also earn such degree by completing a PhD curriculum.Furthermore, the "doctorandus" degree does not give a medical student the right to treat patients; for this a minimum of two years additional study (internships) is required.After obtaining a Medical Board registration, Dutch physicians must work an additional two to six years in a field of expertise to become a registered medical specialist.Dutch surgeons commonly are only granted access to surgeon training and positions after obtaining a doctorate (PhD) successfully.In recent years, the six-year (nominal time) old Curius curriculum (which offered the titles doctorandus and physician) has been replaced with a three-year (nominal time) Bachelor Curius+ followed by a three-year (nominal time) Master Curius+.Those who had already begun their old-style Curius curriculum before that will still have to complete it as a six-year study (nominal time).A doctorandus in law uses the title "meester" (master, abbreviated as mr. Jansen) instead of drs.and some studies like for example technique and agriculture grant the title "ingenieur" (engineer, noted as ir.Jansen) instead of drs.These titles as equivalent to an LL.M (the title mr.) and to a MSc (the title ir.)and if got before September 1, 2002 from a recognized Dutch university, may be rendered as M (from Master) behind one's name, instead of using the typical Dutch shortcuts before one's name.Since September 1, 2002, Dutch universities offer specific BSc, BA or LLB studies followed by MSc, MA or LLM studies, thus integrating into and merging with the international scientific community, offering lectures, other classes, seminars or complete curricula in English instead of Dutch.According to their field of study, MSc graduates may use either ir.or drs.before their names, MA graduates may use drs.before their name and LLM graduates may use mr. before their names, but only if they received such degrees from recognized Dutch universities.Not uncommonly, the Dutch "drs."abbreviation can cause much confusion in other countries, since it is perceived as a person who has a PhD in multiple disciplines.In the Netherlands, the degree MPhil is not legally recognised.
==========
After successfully obtaining a "drs.", "ir."or "mr." degree, a student has the opportunity to follow a promotion study (informally called PhD) to eventually obtain a doctorate and subsequently the title "doctor".Promotion studies are structured ideally according to a preset time schedule of 4 to 6 years, during which the student has to be mentored by at least one professor.The promotion study has to be concluded with at least a scientific thesis, which has to be defended to "a gathering of his/her peers", in practice the Board of the Faculty with guest professors from other faculties and/or universities added.More and more common and in some disciplines even mandatory, is that the student writes and submits scientific publications to peer-reviewed journals, which eventually need to be accepted for publication.The number of publications is often debated and varies considerably between the various disciplines.However, in all disciplines the student is obligated to produce and publish a dissertation or thesis in book form.-- -- -- -- -- Bachelor/master structure  -- -- -- -- --
All current Dutch academic education programs are offered in the Anglo-Saxon bachelor/master structure.It takes three years to earn a bachelor's degree and another one or two years to earn a master's degree.There are three official academic bachelor titles (BA, BSc and LLB) and three official master titles (MA, MSc and LLM).These academic titles are protected by the Dutch government.-- -- -- -- -- Academic title bearing  -- -- -- -- --
After obtaining a doctorate, Dutch doctors may bear either the title dr. (lower case) before or the letter D following their name, but not both simultaneously.There is no specific notation of the discipline in which the doctorate is obtained.Stacking of the titles as seen in countries such as Germany (Prof. Dr. Dr. Dr. Gruber) is highly uncommon in the Netherlands and not well received culturally.Those who have multiple doctor titles may use dr.mult.before their name, but this is seldomly seen in practice.The honoris cause doctors may use dr.h.c.before their name.Combining different Dutch titles, especially in different disciplines, is allowed however (e.g.mr. dr. Jansen, dr. mr. Jansen, dr. ir.Jansen, mr. ir.drs.Jansen, mr. ir.Jansen).The use of the combination ir.ing.is frequent, indicating one holds a HBO, vocational (or professional) engineering degree together with an academic engineering degree.What is not allowed is, after obtaining a doctorate, using dr. drs.Jansen; dr. Jansen should be used instead.
==========
A combination of a Dutch title with an international title is not allowed, except for some limited number of international professional titles.Thus, one should choose either one's classical Dutch title or use the shortcut provided by the law following one's name (since September 1, 2002 it is the other way around: those who hold Dutch degrees as MSc, LLM or MA may optionally use the old-style shortcuts before their names).Hence, formal use of the Anglo-Saxon PhD following one's name is not legal, as it is not a Dutch degree.However, its use is commonly used for clarity towards international readers, for example English publications.The law provides the option of using the shortcut D following one's name instead of dr. before one's name."Doctors" (dr.) can proceed to teach at universities as "universitair docent" (UD – assistant professor).With time, experience and/ or achievement, this can evolve to a position as "universitair hoofddocent" (UHD – associate professor).Officially an UHD still works under the supervision of a "hoogleraar", the head of the department and commonly a professor.However, this is not a given; it is also possible that a department is headed by a "plain" doctor, based on knowledge, achievement and expertise.The position of "hoogleraar" is the highest possible scientific position at a university and equivalent to the US "full" professor.The Dutch professor's title, noted as prof. Jansen or professor Jansen, is connected to one's employment.This means that, should the professor leave the university, he or she also loses the privilege to use the title of professor.Retired professors are an exception and may continue to note the title in front of their name or use the title emeritus professor (em.prof.).People who switch to a non-university job lose their professor title and are only allowed to use the "dr." abbreviation.Unlike some other European countries such as Germany, Dutch academic titles are used rarely outside academia, hold no value in everyday life and typically are not listed on official documentation (e.g.passport, drivers license, (governmental) communication).Dutch academic titles however are legally protected and can only be used by graduates from Dutch institutions of higher education.Illegal use is considered a misdemeanor and subject to legal prosecution.Holders of foreign degrees therefore need special permission before being able to use a recognised Dutch title, but they are free to use their own foreign title (untranslated).In practice, the Public Department does not prosecute the illegal use of a protected title (in the Netherlands applies the principle of opportunity, so some known crimes are not prosecuted).-- -- -- -- Norway  -- -- -- --
Prior to 1980, there were around 50 different degrees and corresponding education programs within the Norwegian higher education system.Degrees had titles that included the gender based Latin term candidatus/candidata.The second part of the title usually consisted of a Latin word corresponding to the profession or training.For example, Cand.Mag.(Candidatus Magisterii) required 4 to 5 years, Cand.Real.(Candidatus Realium) required 6 years of study and a scientific thesis in a select set of scientific disciplines (realia).Over the years these were replaced gradually with degrees that were more and more internationally comparable programs and corresponding titles.
==========
For example, the degree Cand.Scient.replaced Cand.Real.in the period 1985 to 2003.These degrees were all retired in 2003 in favour of an international system.The reform of higher education in Norway, Kvalitetsreformen ("The Quality Reform"), was passed in the Norwegian Parliament, the Storting, in 2001 and carried out during the 2003/2004 academic year.It introduced standard periods of study and the titles master and bachelor (baccalaureus).The system differentiates between a free master's degree and a master's degree in technology.The latter corresponds to the former sivilingeniør degree (not to be confused with a degree in civil engineering, which is but one of many degrees linked to the title sivilingeniør, which is still in use for new graduates who can choose to also use the old title).All pre-2001 doctoral degree titles were replaced with the title "Philosophical Doctor degree", written philosophiæ doctor (instead of the traditional doctor philosophiæ).The title dr. philos.is a substantially higher degree than the PhD and is reserved for those who qualify for such a degree without participating in an organized doctoral degree program.-- -- -- -- Poland  -- -- -- --
In Poland the system is similar to the German one.licencjat title – given by a university; the equivalent of Bachelor of Arts degree or Bachelor of Science degree (depending on academic major); granted after at least 3 years of study.inżynier (inż.)title – Engineer's degree given by a technical university; granted after at least about 4 years of study.magister (mgr) title – the equivalent of a Master of Arts or Master of Science degree, granted after 5–6 years of study or 2 years of additional study by holders of a bachelor degree with classification of Honours Degree.magister inżynier (mgr inż.)title – the equivalent of a Master of Engineering, granted after about 2 years of additional study by holders of a degree of Bachelor of Engineering.doktor (dr) degree – the equivalent of Doctor of Philosophy.doktor habilitowany (dr hab.)degree – Polish Habilitation degree, requires approval by an external ministerial body.profesor (prof.) degree – the highest title, officially conferred by the President of Poland.-- -- -- -- Russia, Ukraine and some other former USSR republics  -- -- -- --
Since 1992, Russian higher education has introduced a multilevel system, enabling higher education institutions to award and issue Bachelor of Science and Master of Science Degrees.In Russia, Ukraine and some other former USSR republics educational degrees are awarded after finishing college education.There are several levels of education one must choose between 2nd and 3rd year usually on the 3rd year of study.Bachelor degree – usually takes 4 years of college.(minimum level to be recognized as having Higher Education)
Specialist degree is awarded after 5 years of college.(4 + 1)
Master's (Magister) degree is awarded after 6 years of college.(4 + 2)(But Specialist degree can appear equivalent to Magister degree by reason of equivalence of amount of educational time).
==========
Usually Specialist or Magister degrees incorporates bachelor's degree in them, but only high-level degree is stated in final diploma.Specialist and Magister degrees require taking final state exams and written work on practical application of studied skills
or research thesis (usually 70-100 pages) and is roughly equivalent to Master's degree.The first level academic degree is called "Kandidat nauk" (that could be translated verbatim as a "Candidate of Sciences").This degree requires extensive research efforts, taking some classes, publications in peer-reviewed academic journals (not less than 5 publications in Ukraine or 3 publications in Russia), taking 3 or more exams (one or more in their speciality, one in a foreign language and one in the history and philosophy of science) and writing and defending an in-depth thesis (80-200 pages) called a "dissertation".Finally, there is a "Doktor Nauk" (that could be translated verbatim as a "Doctor of Sciences") degree in Russia and some former USSR academic environment.This degree is granted for contributions in a certain field (formally – who established new direction or new field in science).It requires discovery of new phenomenon or development of new theory or essential development of new direction, etc.There is no equivalent of this "doctor of sciences" degree in US academic system.It is roughly equivalent to Habilitation in Germany, France, Austria and some other European countries.In countries with a two-tier system of doctoral degrees, the degree of Kandidat Nauk should be considered for recognition at the level of the first doctoral degree.In countries with only one doctoral degree, the degree of Kandidat Nauk should be considered for recognition as equivalent to this degree.According to Guidelines for the recognition of Russian qualifications in the other countries In countries with a two-tier system of doctoral degrees, the degree of Doktor Nauk should be considered for recognition at the level of the second doctoral degree.In countries in which only one doctoral degree exists, the degree of Doktor Nauk should be considered for recognition at the level of this degree.According to International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) UNESCO 2011, par.262 for purposes of international educational statistics

Spain's higher-education legal framework includes: Official and accredited education and Non-official education.1.1 Official and accredited education.In Spain, accreditation of official university study programmes is regulated by law and monitored by governmental agencies responsible for verifying their quality and suitability for official approval and accreditation.Official professional study programmes lead to degree qualifications (Títulos) with full academic and professional effects and the degrees awarded in accordance with the latest higher-education system are:
1.Bachelor’s Degree (Grado) – 240 ECTS Credits in 4 years.2.Master’s Degree (Master Universitario) – 60 to 120 ECTS Credits in 1–2 years.3.Doctoral degree PhD (Doctorado) – in 3–4 years.Accredited bachelor's degrees and master's degrees qualifications will always be described as "Grado" and "Master Universitario".These qualifications comply with the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) framework.Officially approved and accredited university study programmes must implement this framework by law in order to attain and retain accreditation in Spain.1.2 Non-official education.Not all EHEA compliant study programmes in Spain are officially approved and/or accredited by government agencies.Some universities offer proprietary study programmes as an alternative to accredited study programmes for a variety of reasons: attending the continuing education market for individual self-advancement and also providing higher education to individuals that have failed to acquire bachelor's degree qualifications.The main reason for offering this alternative studies, though, is the heavy bureaucratic process that needs to be accomplished to receive the approval of specific titles, in particular when it refers to new studies or studies about matters that do not fit with the official studies.For historical reasons, the academic system has been very much under the control of the State and private universities are still regarded with as a threat to the State system.

These programmes fall within the category of "Non officially approved and accredited" or "Estudios no oficiales" and they have no academic or professional effects.This means that they do not entitle the bearer to claim to have any specific academic or professional qualifications, as far as the Spanish authorities are concerned.However, there may be private agreements to recognize the titles.Universities offering non-official study programmes are legally bound to clearly differentiate between officially approved and non-officially approved qualifications when naming their offer of non-official qualifications.Non-accredited master's degrees will be described as "Master" on its own, without the term "Universitario".Certain non-officially approved and accredited study programmes may acquire a well deserved reputation.However, neither Professional Association, Government Agencies, Judiciary Authorities, nor Universities -other than the study programme provider- are obliged to recognize non-official qualifications in any way.2.Accreditation System
University taught study programmes accreditation is granted through the ANECA, a government dependent quality assurance and accreditation provider for the Spanish Higher Education System and ensures that the data held in the RUCT, a national registry for universities and qualifications, is correct and up to date.All study programmes must be accredited by ANECA prior to their inclusion in the RUCT.The RUCT records all officially approved Universities and their bachelor's degrees, Master's Degrees and PhDs and each and every one of the officially approved and accredited study programmes and universities are assigned a specific number Code (Código) by the RUCT.The same study programme may acquire different codes as it progresses through various stages of official approval by local government and central government.Prospective students should check the RUCT Code awarded to the study programme of their interest at every stage of their enquiries concerning degrees in Spain.ANECA makes recommendations regarding procedures, staffing levels, quality of teaching, resources available to students and continuity or loss of accreditation and the ANECA Registry records all events in the life of an officially approved and accredited study programme or a university.The ANECA Registry Search Facility may be the simplest and safest way to verify the status of all officially approved and accredited study programmes in Spain.It is also possible to track qualifications by using the search facility that several Autonomous Communities own accreditation agencies offer.These agencies work within the ANECA framework and generally show more detailed information about the study programmes available in each territory (i.e.: Catalonia, Madrid, etc.)3.Qualifications framework for Higher Education.The qualifications framework for higher education MECES is the reference framework adopted in Spain in order to structure degree levels.Not all universities offer degrees named exactly the same, even if they have similar academic and professional effects.Each university may present proposals for the study programme considered to meet professional and academic demand.The proposal will consist of a report linking the study programme being considered and the proposed qualification to be awarded.This report will be assessed by ANECA and sent for the Consejo de Universidades Españolas.If the Consejo agrees with ANECA’s approval, it will be included in the RUCT and ANECA registries.4.Spanish qualifications and their professional effects.All bachelor's and master's degrees accredited by ANECA enjoy full academic and professional effects in accordance with new and previous laws.Professional practice law in Spain is currently under revision.

Before the Bologna Process after 4 or 5 years of study the academic degree of a Licentiate was reached.Depending on the official language of the university it was called Lizentiat (German) Licence (French) or licenza (Italian) and is today considered equivalent to the Master's degree according to the Bologna reform.A Licentiate with a predefined qualification gave access to the last stage of further two or more years of studies (depending on the field) for a Doctoral's degree.Apart from this most universities offered a Postgraduate Diploma with up to two years of study.French-speaking universities called them diplôme d'études approfondies DEA or DESS, the Italian-speaking University post laurea and German-speaking universities mostly Nachdiplomstudium (NDS).Today the federal legislation defines these postgraduate diplomas (60 ECTS credits) as Master of Advanced Studies (MAS) or Executive Master of Business Administration (EMBA) degree.Universities may also offer the possibility to gain a Diploma of Advanced Studies (DAS), less than 60 ECTS credits).These degrees do not normally give access to the doctorate study.-- -- -- -- United Kingdom  -- -- -- --

The title 'degree' is protected under UK law.All valid UK degrees are awarded by universities or other degree-awarding bodies whose powers to do so are recognised by the UK government; hence they are known as 'recognised bodies'.The standard first degree in England, Northern Ireland and Wales is the Bachelor's degree conferred with honours.Usually this is a Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree.Other variants exist, for example Bachelor of Education.It usually takes three years to read for a bachelor's degree.The honours are usually categorised into four classes:

First class honours (1st)
Second class honours, divided into:
Upper division or upper second (2:1)
Lower division or lower second (2:2)
Third class honours (3rd)Candidates who have not achieved the standard for the award of honours may be admitted without honours to the 'ordinary' Bachelor's degree if they have met the required standard for this lesser qualification (also referred to as a 'pass degree').Standard levels for each of these classes are 70%+ for a first, 60-69% for a 2:1, 50-59% for a 2:2, 40-49% for a 3rd and 30%+ for a pass degree, although this can vary by institution (e.g.the Open University).The foundation degree is a qualification at lower than Bachelor's level awarded following a two-year programme of study that is usually vocational in nature.The foundation degree can be awarded by a university or college of higher education that has been granted foundation degree awarding powers by the UK government.This degree is comparable to an associate degree in the United States.The universities of Oxford and Cambridge award honorary Master of Arts (MA) degrees to graduates of their Bachelor's programmes, following a specified period of time.This is comparable to the practice of the ancient universities in Scotland of awarding an MA for a first degree and arguably reflects the rigorous standards expected of their graduates.Master's degrees such as Master of Arts or Master of Science are typically awarded to students who have undertaken at least a year of full-time postgraduate study, which may be taught or, in many cases, involve an element of research.Degrees such as Master of Philosophy (MPhil) or Master of Letters/Literature (MLitt) are likely to be awarded for postgraduate degrees involving original research.A student undertaking a Master's would normally be expected to already hold an honours degree in a relevant subject, hence the possibility of reaching Master's level in one year.Some universities award a Master's as a first degree following an integrated programme of study (an 'integrated master's degree').These degrees are usually designated by the subject, such as Master of Engineering for engineering, Master of Physics for physics, Master of Mathematics for mathematics and so on; it usually takes four years to read for them.Graduation to these degrees is always with honours.Master of Engineering in particular has now become the standard first degree in engineering at the top UK universities, replacing the older Bachelor of Engineering.The Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree is highly valued by those seeking to advance in business as managers and decision makers.Doctoral degrees or doctorates, such as the Doctor of Philosophy degree (PhD or DPhil) or Doctor of Education (EdD or DEd) are awarded following a programme of original research that contributes new knowledge within the context of the student's discipline.Doctoral degrees usually take three years full-time.
==========
Therefore, in the UK it may only take seven years to progress from undergraduate to doctoral level – in some cases six, since having a Master's is not always a precondition for embarking on a doctoral degree.This contrasts with nine years in the United States, reflecting differences in the educational systems.Some doctorates, such as the Doctor of Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy) qualification, confirm competence to practice in particular professions.There are also higher doctorates – Doctor of Science (DSc) and Doctor of Letters/Literature (DLitt) that are typically awarded to experienced academics who have demonstrated a high level of achievement in their academic career; for example they may have published widely on their subject or become professors in their field.UK post-secondary qualifications are defined at different levels, with levels 1-3 denoting further education and levels 4-8 denoting higher education.Within this structure, a foundation degree is at level 5; a Bachelor's at level 6; at Master's at level 7; and a doctoral degree at level 8.Full information about the expectations for different types of UK degree is published by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education.See also graduate certificate, graduate diploma, postgraduate certificate, postgraduate diploma and British degree abbreviations.-- -- -- -- -- Scotland  -- -- -- -- --
The standard first degree for students studying arts or humanities in Scotland is either a Bachelor of Arts or a Master of Arts (the latter traditionally awarded by the Ancient Universities of Scotland for a first degree in an arts/humanities subject).The standard undergraduate degree for natural and social science subjects is the Bachelor of Science.Students can work towards a first degree at either ordinary or honours level.A general or ordinary degree (BA/MA or BSc) takes three years to complete; an honours degree (BA/MA Hons or BSc Hons) takes four years.The ordinary degree need not be in a specific subject, but can involve study across a range of subjects within (and sometimes beyond) the relevant faculty, in which case it may also be called a general degree; if a third year or junior honours subject is included, the ordinary degree in that named discipline is awarded.The honours degree involves two years of study at a sub-honours level in which a range of subjects within the relevant faculty are studied and then two years of study at honours level which is specialised in a single field (for example classics, history, chemistry, biology, etc.).Not all Universities in Scotland adhere to this, in some you study in several subjects within a faculty for three years and can then specialise in two areas and attain a joint honours degree in fourth year.This also reflects the broader scope of the final years of Scottish secondary education, where traditionally five Highers are studied, compared to (typically) three English or Welsh A-Levels.The Higher is a one-year qualification, as opposed to the two years of A-Levels, which accounts for Scottish honours degrees being a year longer than those in England.Advanced Highers add an optional final year of secondary education, bringing students up to the level of their A-Level counterparts – students with strong A-Levels or Advanced Highers may be offered entry directly into the second year at Scottish universities.Honours for MA or bachelor's degrees are classified into three classes:

First class honours
Second class honours, divided into:
Division one (2:1) [Upper Second Class Honours]
Division two (2:2) [Lower Second Class Honours]
Third class honoursStudents who complete all the requirements for an honours degree, but do not receive sufficient merit to be awarded third-class honours may be awarded a Special Degree (ordinary degree – bachelor's level SCQF Level 9).In most respects, the criteria for awarding qualifications at honours level and above are the same as in the rest of the UK (see above under England, Wales and Northern Ireland).Postgraduate qualifications are not designated Master of Arts as in the rest of the UK, as this is an undergraduate degree.Postgraduate degrees in arts and humanities subjects are usually designated Master of Letters (M.Litt) or, in natural and social sciences, Master of Science (M.Sc).Non-doctoral postgraduate research degrees are usually designated Master of Philosophy (M.Phil) or Master of Research (M.Res).The postgraduate teaching qualification is the postgraduate diploma in Education (PGDE).Postgraduate qualifications are classified into four classes:

Distinction
Credit
Merit
Pass

In Canada, education is the responsibility of the provinces and territories, rather than the federal government.However, all of Canada follows the three level bachelor's—master's—doctorate system common to the Anglophone world, with a few variations.A common framework for degrees was agreed between the provinces and territories in 2007.Bachelor's degrees are normally three to four years in duration, although more commonly three years in Quebec (where they follow on from college courses rather than directly from secondary education).Master's degrees take one to three years, again with the exception of Quebec where they take one and a half to two years and doctorates take a minimum of three years.Alone among Canadian provinces and territories, British Columbia offers two year associate degrees, allowing credit to be transferred into a four-year bachelor's program.Three year bachelor's degrees are normally ordinary degrees, while four year degrees are honours degrees; an honours degree is normally needed for further study at master's level.In Canada, first professional degrees such as DDS, MD, PharmD and LLB or JD are considered bachelor's level qualifications, despite their often being named as if they were doctorates.-- -- -- -- -- Quebec  -- -- -- -- --
In the province of Quebec, the majority of students must attend college prior to entering university.Upon completion of a two-year pre-university program, such as in Sciences or Humanities or a three-year technical program, such as Nursing or Computer Science, college graduates obtain a college diploma, which is a prerequisite access for university-level studies.
==========
Although the previously mentioned college programs are typical, they are not offered in every institution in the province.Moreover, while a few other pre-university programs with various concentrations exist, many other technical/career programs are available depending on the college of choice.For example, Dawson College in Montreal has nearly sixty different programs leading to a college diploma.Special programs, such as physical rehabilitation therapy, are offered in some colleges as well.These programs are particularly interesting because they allow students to enter professional university programs, such as physiotherapy (which consists of an integrated Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy and Master of Physical Therapy), without having to meet the usual grade and course prerequisites required from students holding a pre-university science diploma.A similar option is offered for college nursing graduates as they can pursue their studies in university to obtain a Bachelor of Nursing in two years (rather than the usual three or four years, depending on whether the student has completed a college diploma in Quebec).Additionally, whereas aspiring medical students are usually required to complete an undergraduate degree before applying to medical schools, Quebec college graduates have the option to enter:

a "medical preparatory" year at McGill University and Université de Montréal and then pursue medical studies for the four following years or
simply directly into the undergraduate medical education program at Université Laval (4 to 5 years in duration) or Université de Sherbrooke (4 years in duration).-- -- -- -- Mexico  -- -- -- --
Education in Mexico follows a three-degree system similar to that of Canada and the US.The pre-university academic level is the bachillerato (also called preparatoria), similar to high school.Students typically leave preparatoria at the age of 18 for university, at which point they choose to specialize in a specific academic area (a carrera).After high school, students progress to university, where they study for a Técnico Superior universitario (Associate degree) or a licenciatura (Bachelor), then a maestría (Master), then a doctorado(doctorate).Once in university, students begin the carrera, the study of a precise academic branch like economics, business administration, sciences, law, engineering or medicine.Students will be in university for 8-10 semesters of full-time study, which typically takes 4–5 years.Upon graduation, students receive a licenciatura  in their chosen subject area, which is equivalent to an American Bachelor's degree.They can also get the degree of "ingenieria" or "medico" that refers to an engineer or MD respectively.Several Mexican universities offer students the possibility of obtaining an equivalent to an Associate degree, called in Mexico Técnico Superior universitario (TSU), studying only half of the licenciatura, with the possibility of finishing a full bachelor's degree later.This is done mainly in fields like engineering and computer sciences.After receiving the licenciatura, students may take extra courses called diplomados (similar to a Certification but issued by a university).These courses last 4–12 months and are a means to further study without continuing to the next degree level, usually studied to demonstrate that the student still updated in his field.Most students stay at this level, but some choose to continue to the maestría, equivalent to the Master's degree.Study at the maestría level takes 1–3 years and mandates completion of a thesis.Post-graduate students in Mexico typically enter a master's program after a few years in the workforce and often continue working while studying.Traditionally, students who have completed the maestria may continue on to the doctorado or the doctorate.Doctoral study typically lasts 3–4 years.In last years this schemes has become flexible such that in some PhD programmes, students are accepted before or not completing at all a Master course.-- -- -- -- United States  -- -- -- --
In the United States, since the late 19th century, the threefold degree system of bachelor, master and doctor has been in place, but has evolved into a slightly different pattern from the European equivalent.The U.S. Department of Education now classifies degrees in six categories: associate degrees, bachelor's degrees, first professional degrees, master's degrees, intermediate graduate qualifications and research doctorates.The standard academic progression remains bachelor's—master's—(research) doctorate.Most standard academic programs are based on the four-year bachelor's degree, most often Bachelor of Arts (B.A.)or Bachelor of Science (B.S.), a one- or two-year master's degree (most often Master of Arts (M.A.)

or Master of Science (M.S.); either of these programs might be as long as three years in length) and a further two to five years of coursework and research, culminating in "comprehensive" examinations in one or more fields, plus perhaps some teaching experience and then the writing of a dissertation for the doctorate, for a total of ten or more years from starting the bachelor's degree (which is usually begun around age 18) to the awarding of the doctorate.This timetable is only approximate, however, as students in accelerated programs can sometimes earn a bachelor's degree in three years or, on the other hand, a particular dissertation project might take four or more years to complete.In addition, a graduate may wait an indeterminate time between degrees before candidacy in the next level or even an additional degree at a level already completed.Therefore, there is no time-limit on the accumulation of academic degrees.By far the most common research doctorate is the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), comprising  98.1% of research doctorates in 2014.The  Doctor of Education (Ed.D.)made up 1.1% (not including Ed.D.s classified as professional degrees rather than research doctorates) and all other research doctorates were less than 1% in total.Some schools, mostly junior colleges and community colleges and some four-year schools, offer an associate degree for two full years of study.These may be in professional or academic fields and the most common awards are the Associate of Arts (A.A.) and Associate of Science (A.S.) degrees.Articulation agreements may allow credit earned on an associate degree to be counted toward completion of a bachelor's degree.The "first professional degree" is a graduate level degree program designed to prepare graduates for professional practice in various fields other than academic scholarship and research.First professional degrees require a minimum of two years prior college-level education to enter the program and a minimum of six years total college-level education (including that undertaken prior to entry) to complete the program.Most professional degree programs require a prior bachelor's degree for admission and many require seven or eight years of total study.Many first professional degrees, e.g.M.D., J.D.or D.O.are named as doctorates but should not be confused with research doctorates such as the Ph.D. First professional degrees should also not be confused with professional master's degrees such as the M.Arch.and M.B.A., which are classified as master's degrees, or with intermediate graduate qualifications that also bear the title of doctor, such as D.Min.or D.Psy.Intermediate graduate qualifications lie between master's level and the doctorate.They include awards such as Advanced Certificates, Advanced Graduate Certificates, Graduate Diplomas, Professional Engineer status and Professional Diplomas, as well as specialist degrees such as Education Specialist, Doctor of Ministry, Doctor of Psychology and the Licentiate in Sacred Theology.In 21 US jurisdictions, religious institutions can be authorized to grant religious-exempt (rel.exmpt., rel.expt.etc.)degrees without accreditation or government oversight.Such degrees are used primarily to attain church-related employment.-- -- -- -- -- Current levels of attainment of degrees  -- -- -- -- --
Traditionally more men than women attended and earned degrees at the world's universities.A milestone was reached in the United States according to results of the 2010 census, as women surpassed men in attaining master's degrees, for the first time.The U.S. census reports that 10.5 million men have master's degrees or higher, compared with 10.6 million women.The first year that women surpassed men in earning bachelor's degrees was in 1996.-- -- -- -- -- Perceptions of the value of a degree in the US  -- -- -- -- --
Students, the media and the general public have shown much concern over the value of getting a higher degree in the US ever since the Great Recession of 2007.A 2015 survey of 2,000 adults (900 of which were graduates), implemented by an education technology company called Greenwood Hall, reported that more than half of the graduates surveyed believe those getting their degree now will be receiving a lower return on their investment than their counterparts 10–15 years ago.
==========
Media coverage of the rising costs of higher education and increased student debt have also affected the public’s perceptions of whether higher degrees are still worthwhile.Statistics citing that college graduates make around $1 million more in their lifetimes than those who didn’t attend college and living longer, healthier lives work in favor of those who argue the continued value of higher degrees.Studies like the 2011 Learning Gains study by Arum and Roksa, on the other hand, reported that only 55% of students had any learning gains during their first two years of college, which favors the argument that investing in higher education may not still be worth it.As academics continue researching and dissecting these arguments, education remains a hot topic in the US as shown by President Obama recently setting a national goal for the US to once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020.-- -- -- Oceania  -- -- --


 -- -- -- -- Australia  -- -- -- --

The Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) covers 10 levels, of which 6 – 10 correspond to academic degrees.These are the associate degree (level 6), which normally takes 2 years, the bachelor degree (level 7), which normally takes 3 years, the bachelor honours degree (level 8), which normally takes 1 year after the bachelor degree and is mostly taken as an optional extension year depending of the discipline, the master degree  (level 9), which normally takes 1 – 2 years for "research" or "coursework" degrees and 3 – 4 years for an "extended" degree and follows on from either a bachelor or honours degree and the doctoral degree (level 10), which normally takes 3 – 4 years following on from a master's degree or a Class I or IIa honours qualification.Also included within the higher education system are graduate certificates and graduate diplomas, both of which are at level 8 (honours degree level), as well as advanced diplomas, at level 6 (associate degree level) and diplomas at level 5 (first year of a degree course).In Australia, most degrees are issued ungraded, with bachelor's degrees with honours being the exception.Doctorates in Australia may be research doctorates (normally titled PhDs) or professional doctorates (normally titled to refer to the field of practice, e.g.Doctor of Engineering.Professional doctorates still require research leading to "a significant and original contribution to knowledge in the context of professional practice" and should not be confused with extended master's degrees that bear similar names for historical reasons: the Juris Doctor and Doctors of Medical Practice, Physiotherapy, Dentistry and Optometry.Despite their names, these extended master's degrees may not be described as doctoral degrees nor do they confer the right to use the title of doctor on their recipients.Some bachelor's degrees (e.g.Bachelor of Engineering or Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery) may take longer than three years to complete and double bachelor's degrees (i.e.completing two bachelor's degrees simultaneously in four to five years) are common.-- -- -- -- New Zealand  -- -- -- --

Like Australia, New Zealand has a 10-level qualifications framework (the New Zealand Qualifications Framework; NZQF) and a referencing exercise has found a one-to-one correspondence between the levels of the two frameworks.However, the names given to qualifications at different levels are not the same and New Zealand does not have associate degrees, thus only levels 7 – 10 correspond to academic degrees.These are the bachelor's degree (level 7), bachelor honours degree (level 8), master's degree (level 9) and the doctoral degree (level 10).In addition to these, the NZQF has certificates across levels 1 – 6, diplomas at levels 5 and 6, graduate certificates and graduate diplomas at level 7 (bachelor's) and postgraduate certificates and postgraduate diplomas at level 8 (honours).Another referencing exercise, comparing the NZQF to the 10-level Irish National Framework for Qualifications found that degrees were comparable but that further work was needed to improve compatibility for the sub-degree levels (1 – 6).Non-degree qualifications at levels 7 – 9 were not included in the study.In New Zealand, master's degrees may be awarded with classified honours (1st, 2:1, 2:2, 3rd) or with distinction or merit.-- -- -- South America  -- -- --

 -- -- -- -- Brazil  -- -- -- --
Undergraduate students in Brazilian universities graduate either with a bachelor's degree, a Licentiate degree or a Technologist degree.Bachelor degrees in Brazil normally takes four or five years of full-time study to complete, with the exception of the human medicine course which requires six years.Licentiate degree, normally takes four-years length degrees, available for students who want to qualify as school teachers.Licenciatura courses exist mostly in mathematics, humanities and natural sciences.Technologist degree is available in technology-related fields and can be normally obtained in three years.These degrees are turned to fast entry the industry.Admission as an undergraduate student in most top public or private universities in Brazil requires that the applicant pass a competitive entrance examination known as Vestibular.Contrary to what happens in the United States, candidates must declare their intended university major when they register for the Vestibular.Although it is theoretically possible to switch majors afterwards (in a process known within the universities as transferência interna), that is actually quite rare in Brazil.Undergraduate curricula tend to be more rigid than in the United States and there is little room to take classes outside one's major.
==========
Individuals who hold either a bachelor's degree, Licentiate or Technologist are eligible for admission into graduate courses leading to advanced master's or doctor's degrees.Criteria for admission into master's and doctor's programs vary in Brazil.Some universities require that candidates take entrance exams; others make admission decisions based solely on undergraduate transcripts, letters of recommendation and possibly oral interviews.In most cases, however, especially for the doctorate, the candidate is required to submit a research plan and one faculty member must agree to serve as his/her supervisor before the candidate can be admitted into the program; The exception are the Natural Sciences post-graduate programs, that accepts students with very broad and/or vague research prospects with sometimes the prospect is given in promptu during the interview, preferring to let the students define their study program and advisor in the course of the first year of studies.There are two types of post-graduate programs, lato sensu (specialization and MBAs) and stricto sensu (Professional Masters, Master and Doctorate):
Specializations or MBAs are courses that include taking a minimum number (minimum 360 hours) of graduate classes but with no need to do research nor defend a thesis, only present a final work showing the knowledge.It's a professional level where theory and practice are focused in a broad sense.Professional Master's or master's degrees usually takes one to two years of full-time study.Requirements for an academic master's degree include taking a minimum number of advanced graduate classes (typically between five and eight)and submitting a research thesis which is examined orally by a panel of at least two examiners (three is the preferred number), sometimes including one external member who must be from another university or research institute.The emphasis of the thesis must be in adding some value to the academic knowledge, but not necessarily in being original.Doctor's degrees normally take four additional years of full-time study to complete.Requirements for obtaining a doctor's degree include taking additional advanced courses, passing an oral qualifying exam and submitting a longer doctoral dissertation which must represent a significant original contribution to knowledge in the field to which the dissertation topic is related.That contrasts with master's thesis, which, in addition to being usually shorter than doctoral dissertations, are not required to include creation of new knowledge or revision/reinterpretation of older views/theories.The doctoral dissertation is examined in a final oral exam before a panel of at least two members (in the state of São Paulo the preferred number is five, while the other regions prefer three members), usually including one or two external examiners from another university or research institute.Finally, a small number of Brazilian universities, most notably the public universities in the state of São Paulo still award the title of Livre-Docente (free docent), which is of higher standing than a doctorate and is obtained, similar to the German Habilitation, by the submission of a second (original or cumulative) thesis and approval in a Livre-Docência examination that includes giving a public lecture before a panel of full professors.See also Universities and Higher Education in Brazil


 -- -- -- -- Colombia  -- -- -- --
In Colombia, the system of academic degrees is based in the British model been similar to the U.S. model.After completing their "bachillerato" (high school), students can take one of three options.The first one is called a "Profesional" (professional career), which is similar to a bachelor's degree requiring from four to 6 years of study according to the chosen program.The other option is called a "Técnico" (technician); this degree consists in two and a half years of study and prepares the student for technical or mechanical labors.Finally, the third option is called a ¨Tecnólogo¨ (equivalent to associate degree) and consist of 3 years of study.After this, students, now called "profesional" (professionals), Tecnólogos (associates) or "técnicos" (technicians), can opt for higher degrees.Formal education after the bachelor's degree is the master's degree with the title of "Maestro" and Doctorate's degree known as "Doctorado" (doctorate).The master's degree normally consists of two years.Students also can take an specialization course, "Especialización", equivalent to a graduate certificate degree, after their bachelor's degree.These programs, like in the U.S. are very popular, because it requires only one to two years of study.A similar situation in Colombia, when compared to the U.S. system, is that the students may not go directly to the "Doctorado" without having the "Master" degree first.-- -- -- -- Chile  -- -- -- --
In Chile, the system in a nutshell is as follows:
Quite similar to the case described for Colombia, students may opt to be "Profesionales"(Professionals) or "Técnicos"(Technicians).After completion of high school, students may follow professional or technical studies at Universities or Technical schools.Only Universities and the Academies of the Armed Forces can give Academic Degrees.In general, traditional professions require an Academic Degree, but there are many professions that not require the degree because they were conceived as strictly "professional" not academic.The degrees are as follows:
"Licenciado" it is similar to the Bachelor, but to get it is necessary to complete at least eight semesters of study on the subjects which are part of the Major.
==========
This degree is enough to continue developing an academic career, however, to get a professional title -which is not academic, but allows you to get a professional practice, you have to continue one or two additional years of study.(For example, to be an engineer it is necessary to study four years to get a Licentiate in Engineering Sciences and two additional years to get a Professional Title and become an engineer.Sometimes it is possible to take additional subjects and get a "Magister" degree besides the professional title.)"Magister" is the equivalent to the master's degree in English speaking countries."Doctorado" is the equivalent to the Doctorate or Phd.There is no separate classification for Professional Doctorates.In particular, the engineering profession may be complicated for the foreigner since there are two types of engineers: those who got an Academic Degree such as Civil Engineers or Armed Forced Politechnical Engineers and those who are "Ingenieros en Ejecución" (Professional Engineers) which are considered terrain Engineer more focused to apply the engineering in the field and completed only four years of study.They are not able, by law, to authorise plans or drawings like engineers with a degree or architects.-- -- -- -- Venezuela  -- -- -- --
Titles in Venezuela start with the Certificado de Educación Básica (Certificate of Basic Education), awarded upon completing 9th grade.The next title is earned upon completing 11th grade and may be Bachiller en Ciencias (High School Graduate of Science), Bachiller en Humanidades (High School Graduate of Humanities) or Técnico en Ciencias (Science Technician).The reason for this diversity is because some schools provide vocational education as part of their high school curriculum (thereby allowing them to hand out "Technician" titles) while elsewhere, the student is required to decide whether to study Sciences or Humanities for the last two years of secondary school.Titles at the higher education level usually depend on the institution handing them out.Technical schools award the student with the title of Técnico Superior Universitario (University Higher Technician, to distinguish from Science Technician).Universities award the student with the title of Ingeniero (Engineer) or with the title Licenciado (Licentiate) after completing a five-year program.The Engineer have more physics subjects than the Licentiate, but both are five-year careers.Some higher education institutions may award Diplomados (Diploma) but the time necessary to obtain one varies.Medical Doctors are awarded the title "Médico Cirujano" after completing a 6 year-career.Post-graduate education follows conventions of the United States (being named "Master's" and "Doctorate" after the programs there)


 -- -- Pontifical universities  -- --
Pontifical universities around the world such as the Pontifical University, St Patrick's College, Maynooth in Ireland, the Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas in Manila, The Catholic University of America, the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in Rome, the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) in Belgium and the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru depend for their status as pontifical universities and for the nature of their academic degrees on the Pope through the Congregation for Catholic Education.The nature of academic degrees from ecclesiastical institutions of education is outlined in the apostolic constitution Sapientia Christiana,In distinction to secular or Catholic universities, which are academic institutions for the study and teaching of a broad range of disciplines, Ecclesiastical or Pontifical universities "are usually composed of three principal ecclesiastical faculties, theology, philosophy and canon law and at least one other faculty.A Pontifical university specifically addresses Christian revelation and disciplines correlative to the evangelical mission of the Church as set out in the apostolic constitution Sapientia christiana."There are three cycles of degrees that constitute the core of degrees granted by pontifical universities: the first cycle leading to the baccalaureate degree; the second cycle leading to the licentiate degree; the third cycle leading to the doctorate.From this core pontifical universities confer degrees including:Theology:

Baccalaureate in Sacred Theology, Sacrae Theologiae Baccalaureatus (S.T.B.)Licentiate in Sacred Theology, Sacrae Theologiae Licentiatus (S.T.L.)Doctorate in Sacred Theology, Sacrae Theologiae Doctoratus (S.T.D.)Philosophy:
