"O Come, All Ye Faithful" (originally written in Latin as Adeste Fideles) is a Christmas carol that has been attributed to various authors, including John Francis Wade (1711–1786), John Reading (1645–1692), King John IV of Portugal (1604–1656), and anonymous monks.The earliest printed version is in a book published by Wade, but the earliest manuscript bears the name of King John IV, and is located in the library of the Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa.A manuscript by Wade, dating to 1751, is held by Stonyhurst College in Lancashire.The original four verses of the hymn were extended to a total of eight, and these have been translated into many languages.The English translation of "O Come, All Ye Faithful" by the English Catholic priest Frederick Oakeley, written in 1841, is widespread in most English-speaking countries.-- -- Text  -- --
The original text of the hymn has been from time to time attributed to various groups and individuals, including St. Bonaventure in the 13th century or King John IV of Portugal in the 17th, though it was more commonly believed that the text was written by Cistercian monks – the German, Portuguese or Spanish provinces of that order having at various times been credited.In modern English hymnals, the text is usually credited to John Francis Wade, whose name appears on the earliest printed versions.However, this is most likely an error of attribution.Wade, an English Catholic, lived in exile in France and made a living as a copyist of musical manuscripts which he found in libraries.He often signed his copies, possibly because his calligraphy was so beautiful that his clients requested this.In 1751 he published a printed compilation of his manuscript copies, Cantus Diversi pro Dominicis et Festis per annum.This is the first printed source for Adeste Fideles.The version published by Wade consisted of four Latin verses.But later in the 18th century, the French Catholic priest Jean-François-Étienne Borderies (fr) wrote an additional three verses in Latin; these are normally printed as the third to fifth of seven verses.Another anonymous, additional Latin verse is rarely printed.The text has been translated innumerable times into English.The most common version today is a combination of one of Frederick Oakeley's translations of the original four verses, and William Thomas Brooke's translation of the three additional verses.It was first published in Murray's Hymnal in 1852.Oakeley originally titled the song "Ye Faithful, approach ye" when it was sung at his Margaret Church in Marylebone (London), before it was altered to its current form.The song was sometimes referred to as the "Portuguese Hymn" after the Duke of Leeds, in 1795, heard a version of it sung at the Portuguese embassy in London.The most commonly named Portuguese author is King John IV of Portugal, "The Musician King" (reigned 1640–1656).John was a patron of music and the arts, and a considerably sophisticated writer on music; and he was also a composer.During his reign he collected one of the largest musical libraries in the world, which was destroyed in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.He also founded a Music School in Vila Viçosa that "exported" musicians to Spain and Italy.
==========
It was at John's Vila Viçosa palace that two manuscripts of the "Portuguese Hymn" have been found and dated to 1640.These manuscripts predate Wade's eighteenth-century versions, whether printed or manuscript.(However, McKim and Randell nonetheless argue for Wade's authorship of the version people are now familiar with.)Among King John's writings is a Defense of Modern Music (Lisbon, 1649).In the same year (1649) he had a huge struggle to get instrumental music approved by the Vatican for use in the Catholic Church.Another famous composition of his is a setting of the Crux fidelis, a work that remains highly popular during Lent among church choirs.-- -- Tune  -- --
Besides John Francis Wade, the tune has been attributed to several musicians, from John Reading and his son, to Handel, and even the German composer Gluck.The Portuguese composer Marcos Portugal or King John IV of Portugal have also been credited.Thomas Arne, whom Wade knew, is another possible composer.There are several similar musical themes written around that time, though it can be hard to determine whether these were written in imitation of the hymn, whether the hymn was based on them, or whether they are totally unconnected.-- -- Published versions  -- --

The hymn was first published by John Francis Wade in his collection Cantus Diversi (1751), with four Latin verses, and music set in the traditional square notation used for medieval liturgical music.It was published again in the 1760 edition of Evening Offices of the Church.It also appeared in Samuel Webbe's An Essay on the Church Plain Chant (1782).The hymn tune also made its way to the Sacred Harp tradition, appearing as "Hither Ye Faithful, Haste with Songs of Triumph" in an 1860 collection.-- -- Lyrics  -- --
These are the original four Latin verses as published by Wade, along with their English translation by Frederick Oakeley.These are the additional Latin verses composed in the 18th century, with English prose translations, not from Oakeley:


 -- -- -- Jacobite connection  -- -- --
The words of the hymn have been interpreted as a Jacobite birth ode to Bonnie Prince Charlie.Professor Bennett Zon, head of music at Durham University, has interpreted it this way, claiming that the secret political code was decipherable by the "faithful" (the Jacobites), with "Bethlehem" a common Jacobite cipher for England and Regem Angelorum a pun on Angelorum (Angels) and Anglorum (English).Wade had fled to France after the Jacobite rising of 1745 was crushed.From the 1740s to 1770s the earliest forms of the carol commonly appeared in English Roman Catholic liturgical books close to prayers for the exiled Old Pretender.In the books by Wade it was often decorated with Jacobite floral imagery, as were other liturgical texts with coded Jacobite meanings.-- -- Performance  -- --
In performance, verses are often omitted – either because the hymn is too long in its entirety or because the words are unsuitable for the day on which they are sung.

Accompaniment is the musical part which provides the rhythmic and/or harmonic support for the melody or main themes of a song or instrumental piece.There are many different styles and types of accompaniment in different genres and styles of music.In homophonic music, the main accompaniment approach used in popular music, a clear vocal melody is supported by subordinate chords.In popular music and traditional music, the accompaniment parts typically provide the "beat" for the music and outline the chord progression of the song or instrumental piece.The accompaniment for a vocal melody or instrumental solo can be played by a single musician playing an instrument such as piano, pipe organ, or guitar.While any instrument can in theory be used as an accompaniment instrument, keyboard and guitar-family instruments tend to be used if there is only a single instrument, as these instruments can play chords and basslines simultaneously (chords and a bassline are easier to play simultaneously on keyboard instruments, but a fingerpicking guitarist can play chords and a bassline simultaneously on guitar).A solo singer can accompany herself by playing guitar or piano while she sings, and in some rare cases, a solo singer can even accompany himself or herself just using his or her voice and body (e.g., Bobby McFerrin).Alternatively, the accompaniment to a vocal melody or instrumental solo can be provided by a musical ensemble, ranging in size from a duo (e.g., cello and piano; guitar and double bass; synthesizer and percussion); a trio (e.g., a rock power trio of electric guitar, electric bass and drum kit; an organ trio); a quartet (e.g., a string quartet in Classical music can accompany a solo singer; a rock band or rhythm section in rock and pop; a jazz quartet in jazz); all the way to larger ensembles, such as concert bands, Big Bands (in jazz), pit orchestras in musical theatre; and orchestras, which, in addition to playing symphonies, can also provide accompaniment to a concerto solo instrumentalist or to solo singers in opera.With choral music, the accompaniment to a vocal solo can be provided by other singers in the choir, who sing harmony parts or countermelodies.Accompaniment parts range from so simple that a beginner can play them (e.g., simple three-note triad chords in a traditional folk song) to so complex that only an advanced player or singer can perform them (e.g., the piano parts in Schubert's Lieder art songs from the 19th century or vocal parts from a Renaissance music motet).-- -- Definition  -- --

An accompanist is a musician who plays an accompaniment part.Accompanists often play keyboard instruments (e.g., piano, pipe organ, synthesizer) or, in folk music and traditional styles, a guitar.While sight-reading (the ability to play a notated piece of music without preparing it) is important for many types of musicians, it is essential for professional accompanists.In auditions for musical theater and orchestras, an accompanist will often have to sight read music.A number of classical pianists have found success as accompanists rather than soloists; arguably the best known example is Gerald Moore, well known as a Lieder accompanist.In some American schools, the term collaborative piano is used, and hence, the title "collaborative pianist" (or collaborative artist) is replacing the title accompanist, because in many art songs and contemporary classical music songs, the piano part is complex and demands an advanced level of musicianship and technique.The term accompanist also refers to a musician (typically a pianist) who plays for singers, dancers, and other performers at an audition or rehearsal—but who does not necessarily participate in the ensemble that plays for the final performance (which might be an orchestra or a big band).-- -- -- Accompaniment figure  -- -- --
An accompaniment figure is a musical gesture used repeatedly in an accompaniment, such as:

Alberti bass and other arpeggio figures
Ostinati figures (repeated lines) or, in popular music, riffsNotated accompaniment may be indicated obbligato (obliged) or ad libitum (at one's pleasure).-- -- -- Dialogue accompaniment  -- -- --
Dialogue accompaniment is a form of call and response in which the lead and accompaniment alternate, the accompaniment playing during the rests of the lead and providing a drone or silence during the main melody or vocal.-- -- Notation and improvisation  -- --
The accompaniment instrumentalists and/or singers can be provided with a fully notated accompaniment part written or printed on sheet music.This is the norm in Classical music and in most large ensemble writing (e.g., orchestra, pit orchestra, choir).In popular music and traditional music, the accompaniment instrumentalists often improvise their accompaniment, either based on a lead sheet or chord chart which indicates the chords used in the song or piece (e.g., C Major, d minor, G7, or Nashville Numbers or Roman numerals, such as I, ii, V7, etc.)or by "playing by ear".Chord-playing musicians (e.g., those playing guitar, piano, Hammond organ, etc.)can improvise chords, "fill-in" melodic lines and solos from the chord chart.It is rare for chords to be fully written out in music notation in pop and traditional music.Some guitarists, bassists and other stringed instrumentalists read accompaniment parts using tabulature (or "tab"), a notation system which shows the musician where on the instrument to play the notes.

David Grisman (born March 23, 1945) is an American mandolinist.His music combines bluegrass, folk, and jazz in a genre he calls "Dawg music".He founded the record label Acoustic Disc, which issues his recordings and those of other acoustic musicians.-- -- Biography  -- --
Grisman grew up in a Conservative Jewish household in Passaic, New Jersey.His father was professional trombonist who gave him piano lessons when he was seven years old.As teenager, he played piano, mandolin, and saxophone.In the early 1960s, he went to college at New York University.He belonged to the Even Dozen Jug Band with Maria Muldaur and John Sebastian.He played in the bluegrass band the Kentuckians led by Red Allen, then in the psychedelic rock band Earth Opera with Peter Rowan.He moved to San Francisco, met Jerry Garcia, and appeared on the Grateful Dead album American Beauty.He played in Garcia's bluegrass band Old & In the Way with Peter Rowan and Vassar Clements.Garcia named him "Dawg" after a dog that was following him while they were driving in Stinson Beach, California."Dawg Music" is what Grisman calls his mixture of bluegrass and Django Reinhardt/Stéphane Grappelli-influenced jazz as highlighted on his album Hot Dawg (recorded Oct. 1978, released 1979).It was Grisman's combination of Reinhardt-era jazz, bluegrass, folk, Old World Mediterranean string band music, as well as modern jazz fusion that came to embody "Dawg" music.In the 1970s, he started the David Grisman Quintet with Darol Anger, Joe Carroll, Todd Phillips, and Tony Rice.They released their first album in 1977 for Kaleidoscope Records and their second, Hot Dawg, two years later for Horizon Records, the jazz division of A&M Records.When the quintet recorded for Warner Bros. Records, the membership changed to include Mike Marshall, Mark O'Connor, and Rob Wasserman, with occasional guest appearances by jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli.In the 1980s, Grisman formed the record label Acoustic Disc, which issued his recordings and those by other acoustic musicians.Beginning in the 1990s, he released albums with a more jazz oriented sound when he recorded with bassist Jim Kerwin, drummer George Marsh, and guitarist Martin Taylor.But the folk and bluegrass part of his personality emerged when he recorded with Mark O'Connor, Tony Rice, and Andy Statman.On the albums Tone Poems and Tone Poems 2, he recorded traditional jazz and folk songs on vintage guitars, mandolins, and mandocellos that were built at the time the songs were composed.-- -- Family  -- --
Grisman is married to Tracy Bigelow and was married twice before.He has three grown children: Samson, Gillian, and Monroe.Samson, a bassist and recording session musician living in Portland, often performs with his father.Gillian, a filmmaker living in Novato, California, directed Grateful Dawg and the music documentary, Village Music: Last of the Great Record Stores.Monroe, named for bluegrass music pioneer Bill Monroe, lives in Fairfax, California, and plays in the Tom Petty tribute band Petty Theft.-- -- In media  -- --
Grisman's song "Dawggy Mountain Breakdown" was the opening theme song for Car Talk on NPR.Grisman sued YouTube in May 2007, asserting in federal court that YouTube should be required to prevent individuals from illegally uploading recordings of his music.Grisman's attorneys requested voluntary dismissal of the suit.The documentary Grateful Dawg (October 14, 2001) chronicles the friendship between Jerry Garcia and David Grisman.Grisman was a judge for the 6th and 7th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists.He wrote much of the bluegrass music for the 1974 film Big Bad Mama directed by Roger Corman.

Albert Einstein ( EYEN-styne; German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (listen); 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula

  , which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field.This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909).However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields, and he published a paper on general relativity in 1916 with his theory of gravitation.He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules.He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.Except for one year in Prague, Einstein lived in Switzerland between 1895 and 1914, during which time he renounced his German citizenship in 1896, then received his academic diploma from the Swiss federal polytechnic school (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Zürich in 1900.After being stateless for more than five years, he acquired Swiss citizenship in 1901, which he kept for the rest of his life.In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich.The same year, he published four groundbreaking papers during his renowned annus mirabilis (miracle year) which brought him to the notice of the academic world at the age of 26.Einstein taught theoretical physics at Zurich between 1912 and 1914, before he left for Berlin, where he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences.In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power.Because of his Jewish background, Einstein did not return to Germany.He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential development of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type" and recommending that the US begin similar research.This eventually led to the Manhattan Project.Einstein supported the Allies, but he generally denounced the idea of using nuclear fission as a weapon.He signed the Russell–Einstein Manifesto with British philosopher Bertrand Russell, which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons.He was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955.Einstein published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works.His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".Eugene Wigner wrote of Einstein in comparison to his contemporaries that "Einstein's understanding was deeper even than Jancsi von Neumann's.His mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann's.And that is a very remarkable statement."

 -- -- -- Early life and education  -- -- --

Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879.His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch.In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.The Einsteins were non-observant Ashkenazi Jews, and Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the age of 5, for three years.At the age of 8, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the German Empire seven years later.In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient alternating current (AC) standard.The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory.In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia.When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium.His father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method.He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning.At the end of December 1894, he travelled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note.During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title "On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field".Einstein always excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers.The twelve-year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer.Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean theorem at age 12.A family tutor Max Talmud says that after he had given the 12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a short time "[Einstein] had worked through the whole book.He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics...Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow."His passion for geometry and algebra led the twelve-year-old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a "mathematical structure".Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a 14-year-old he says he had "mastered integral and differential calculus".At age 13, Einstein was introduced to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, and Kant became his favorite philosopher, his tutor stating: "At the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant's works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him."In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH).He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination, but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics.On the advice of the principal of the Polytechnic, he attended the Argovian cantonal school (gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling.While lodging with the family of professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie.Albert's sister Maja later married Winteler's son Paul.In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of Württemberg to avoid military service.In September 1896, he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1–6.At 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Zürich Polytechnic.Marie Winteler, who was a year older, moved to Olsberg, Switzerland, for a teaching post.Einstein's future wife, a 20-year-old Serbian woman Mileva Marić, also enrolled at the Polytechnic that year.
==========
She was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course.Over the next few years, Einstein's and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest.In 1900, Einstein passed the exams in Maths and Physics and was awarded the Federal Polytechnic teaching diploma.There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions.-- -- -- Marriages and children  -- -- --

An early correspondence between Einstein and Marić was discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the couple had a daughter named "Lieserl", born in early 1902 in Novi Sad where Marić was staying with her parents.Marić returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and fate are unknown.The contents of Einstein's letter in September 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.Einstein and Marić married in January 1903.In May 1904, their son Hans Albert Einstein was born in Bern, Switzerland.Their son Eduard was born in Zürich in July 1910.The couple moved to Berlin in April 1914, but Marić returned to Zürich with their sons after learning that Einstein's chief romantic attraction was his first and second cousin Elsa.They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years.Eduard had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia.His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, finally being committed permanently after her death.In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love Marie Winteler about his marriage and his strong feelings for her.He wrote in 1910, while his wife was pregnant with their second child: "I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be."He spoke about a "misguided love" and a "missed life" regarding his love for Marie.Einstein married Elsa Löwenthal in 1919, after having a relationship with her since 1912.She was a first cousin maternally and a second cousin paternally.They emigrated to the United States in 1933.Elsa was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems in 1935 and died in December 1936.-- -- -- Friends  -- -- --
Among Einstein's well-known friends were Michele Besso, Paul Ehrenfest, Marcel Grossmann, János Plesch, Daniel Q. Posin, Maurice Solovine, and Stephen Wise.-- -- -- Patent office  -- -- --

After graduating in 1900, Einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post.He acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901, but for medical reasons was not conscripted.With the help of Marcel Grossmann's father, he secured a job in Bern at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property, the patent office, as an assistant examiner – level III.Einstein evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter.In 1903, his position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he "fully mastered machine technology".Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical–mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time.With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group in 1902, self-mockingly named "The Olympia Academy", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy.Their readings included the works of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, and David Hume, which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.-- -- -- -- First scientific papers  -- -- -- --

In 1900, Einstein's paper "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen" ("Conclusions from the Capillarity Phenomena") was published in the journal Annalen der Physik.On 30 April 1905, Einstein completed his thesis, with Alfred Kleiner, Professor of Experimental Physics, serving as pro-forma advisor.
==========
As a result, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich, with his dissertation A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions.In that same year, which has been called Einstein's annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.-- -- -- Academic career  -- -- --
By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern.The following year, after giving a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the University of Zürich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics.Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so.During his Prague stay, he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids.In July 1912, he returned to his alma mater in Zürich.From 1912 until 1914, he was professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics.He also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Grossmann.On 3 July 1913, he was voted for membership in the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin.Max Planck and Walther Nernst visited him the next week in Zurich to persuade him to join the academy, additionally offering him the post of director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, which was soon to be established.(Membership in the academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching duties at the Humboldt University of Berlin.)He was officially elected to the academy on 24 July, and he accepted to move to the German Empire the next year.His decision to move to Berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin Elsa, with whom he had developed a romantic affair.He joined the academy and thus the Berlin University on 1 April 1914.As World War I broke out that year, the plan for Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics was aborted.The institute was established on 1 October 1917, with Einstein as its director.In 1916, Einstein was elected president of the German Physical Society (1916–1918).Based on calculations Einstein made in 1911, about his new theory of general relativity, light from another star should be bent by the Sun's gravity.In 1919, that prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919.Those observations were published in the international media, making Einstein world-famous.On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper The Times printed a banner headline that read: "Revolution in Science – New Theory of the Universe – Newtonian Ideas Overthrown".In 1920, he became a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.In 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".While the general theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial, the citation also does not treat even the cited photoelectric work as an explanation but merely as a discovery of the law, as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the Planck spectrum by S. N. Bose.Einstein was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1921.He also received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1925.-- -- -- 1921–1922: Travels abroad  -- -- --
Einstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921, where he received an official welcome by Mayor John Francis Hylan, followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions.He went on to deliver several lectures at Columbia University and Princeton University, and in Washington he accompanied representatives of the National Academy of Science on a visit to the White House.On his return to Europe he was the guest of the British statesman and philosopher Viscount Haldane in London, where he met several renowned scientific, intellectual and political figures, and delivered a lecture at King's College London.
==========
He also published an essay, "My First Impression of the U.S.A.", in July 1921, in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of Americans, much as had Alexis de Tocqueville, who published his own impressions in Democracy in America (1835).For some of his observations, Einstein was clearly surprised: "What strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life ...The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and without envy."In 1922, his travels took him to Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour, as he visited Singapore, Ceylon and Japan, where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese.After his first public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at the Imperial Palace, where thousands came to watch.In a letter to his sons, he described his impression of the Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for art.In his own travel diaries from his 1922–23 visit to Asia, he expresses some views on the Chinese, Japanese and Indian people, which have been described as xenophobic and racist judgments when they were rediscovered in 2018.Because of Einstein's travels to the Far East, he was unable to personally accept the Nobel Prize for Physics at the Stockholm award ceremony in December 1922.In his place, the banquet speech was held by a German diplomat, who praised Einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist.On his return voyage, he visited Palestine for 12 days in what would become his only visit to that region.He was greeted as if he were a head of state, rather than a physicist, which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the British high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel.During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him.In Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.Einstein visited Spain for two weeks in 1923, where he briefly met Santiago Ramón y Cajal and also received a diploma from King Alfonso XIII naming him a member of the Spanish Academy of Sciences.From 1922 to 1932, Einstein was a member of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations in Geneva (with a few months of interruption in 1923–1924), a body created to promote international exchange between scientists, researchers, teachers, artists and intellectuals.Originally slated to serve as the Swiss delegate, Secretary-General Eric Drummond was persuaded by Catholic activists Oskar Halecki and Giuseppe Motta to instead have him become the German delegate, thus allowing Gonzague de Reynold to take the Swiss spot, from which he promoted traditionalist Catholic values.Einstein’s former physics professor Hendrik Lorentz and the French chemist Marie Curie were also members of the committee.-- -- -- 1930–1931: Travel to the US  -- -- --
In December 1930, Einstein visited America for the second time, originally intended as a two-month working visit as a research fellow at the California Institute of Technology.After the national attention he received during his first trip to the US, he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy.Although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, he declined them all.After arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various places and events, including Chinatown, a lunch with the editors of The New York Times, and a performance of Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera, where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival.During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as "the ruling monarch of the mind".Harry Emerson Fosdick, pastor at New York's Riverside Church, gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance.Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration.Einstein next traveled to California, where he met Caltech president and Nobel laureate, Robert A. Millikan.His friendship with Millikan was "awkward", as Millikan "had a penchant for patriotic militarism", where Einstein was a pronounced pacifist.During an address to Caltech's students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good.This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for their pacifism.Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios, gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin.They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner.Chaplin said Einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a "highly emotional temperament", from which came his "extraordinary intellectual energy".Chaplin's film, City Lights, was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests.Walter Isaacson, Einstein's biographer, described this as "one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity".Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin, and recalled his "modest little flat" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory.

Chaplin speculated that it was "possibly used as kindling wood by the Nazis".-- -- -- 1933: Immigration to the US  -- -- --

In February 1933, while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler.While at American universities in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.He and his wife Elsa returned to Europe by ship in March, and during the trip they learned that the German Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which transformed Hitler's government into a de facto legal dictatorship and that they would not be able to proceed to Berlin.Later on they heard that their cottage was raided by the Nazis and his personal sailboat confiscated.Upon landing in Antwerp, Belgium on 28 March, he immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship.The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a Hitler Youth camp.After staying some days at Castle Cantecroy in Mortsel, a villa was rented in De Haan on the Belgian coast for half a year.On 9 September, they took the ferry to Dover, and arrived in the US on 17 October.-- -- -- -- Refugee status  -- -- -- --

In April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities.Historian Gerald Holton describes how, with "virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues", thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.A month later, Einstein's works were among those targeted by the German Student Union in the Nazi book burnings, with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels proclaiming, "Jewish intellectualism is dead."One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, "not yet hanged", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head.In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend Max Born, who had already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, "...I must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise."After moving to the US, he described the book burnings as a "spontaneous emotional outburst" by those who "shun popular enlightenment", and "more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence".Einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany.He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months.In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years.To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside London, with a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein, published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.Locker-Lampson took Einstein to meet Winston Churchill at his home, and later, Austen Chamberlain and former Prime Minister Lloyd George.Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany.British historian Martin Gilbert notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend, physicist Frederick Lindemann, to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in British universities.Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out, they had lowered their "technical standards" and put the Allies' technology ahead of theirs.Einstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including Turkey's Prime Minister, İsmet İnönü, to whom he wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists.As a result of Einstein's letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over "1,000 saved individuals".Locker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe.In one of his speeches he denounced Germany's treatment of Jews, while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere.In his speech he described Einstein as a "citizen of the world" who should be offered a temporary shelter in the UK.Both bills failed, however, and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey, US, to become a resident scholar.-- -- -- -- Resident scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study  -- -- -- --

In October 1933, Einstein returned to the US and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study, noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany.At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their Jewish quotas, which lasted until the late 1940s.Einstein was still undecided on his future.He had offers from several European universities, including Christ Church, Oxford where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered a 5-year studentship, but in 1935, he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship.Einstein's affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955.
==========
He was one of the four first selected (two of the others being John von Neumann and Kurt Gödel) at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with Gödel.The two would take long walks together discussing their work.Bruria Kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist.During this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully.-- -- -- -- World War II and the Manhattan Project  -- -- -- --

In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist Leó Szilárd attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research.The group's warnings were discounted.Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, "regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon."To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered.He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilárd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.The letter is believed to be "arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II".In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office.Some say that as a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the US entered the "race" to develop the bomb, drawing on its "immense material, financial, and scientific resources" to initiate the Manhattan Project.For Einstein, "war was a disease ... [and] he called for resistance to war."By signing the letter to Roosevelt, some argue he went against his pacifist principles.In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, "I made one great mistake in my life—when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification—the danger that the Germans would make them ..."


 -- -- -- -- US citizenship  -- -- -- --

Einstein became an American citizen in 1940.Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study (in Princeton, New Jersey), he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in American culture when compared to Europe.He recognized the "right of individuals to say and think what they pleased", without social barriers, and as a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his own early education.Einstein joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned for the civil rights of African Americans.He considered racism America's "worst disease", seeing it as "handed down from one generation to the next".As part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist W. E. B.Du Bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951.When Einstein offered to be a character witness for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case.In 1946 Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree.(Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college degrees to African Americans; alumni include Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall.)Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, adding, "I do not intend to be quiet about it."A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student.-- -- -- Personal life  -- -- --


 -- -- -- -- Assisting Zionist causes  -- -- -- --
Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which opened in 1925, and was among its first Board of Governors.Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university.He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs.
==========
Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land.That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an "evil" that was undermining a third of the country's development.Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important.Chaim Weizmann later became Israel's first president.Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the position of President of Israel, a mostly ceremonial post.The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer "embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons".Einstein declined, and wrote in his response that he was "deeply moved", and "at once saddened and ashamed" that he could not accept it.-- -- -- -- Love of music  -- -- -- --

Einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age.In his late journals he wrote: "If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician.I often think in music.I live my daydreams in music.I see my life in terms of music...I get most joy in life out of music."His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into German culture.According to conductor Leon Botstein, Einstein began playing when he was 5.However, he did not enjoy it at that age.When he turned 13, he discovered the violin sonatas of Mozart, whereupon he became enamored of Mozart's compositions and studied music more willingly.Einstein taught himself to play without "ever practicing systematically".He said that "love is a better teacher than a sense of duty."At age 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau while playing Beethoven's violin sonatas.The examiner stated afterward that his playing was "remarkable and revealing of 'great insight'".What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein "displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply.Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student."Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein's life from that period on.Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends.Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others.He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Köchel catalogue of Mozart's work; that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein, who may have been a distant relation.In 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of Beethoven and Mozart's works with members of the Zoellner Quartet.Near the end of his life, when the young Juilliard Quartet visited him in Princeton, he played his violin with them, and the quartet was "impressed by Einstein's level of coordination and intonation".-- -- -- -- Political and religious views  -- -- -- --

Einstein's political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as "Why Socialism?".
==========
Einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics.He strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation.The FBI created a secret dossier on Einstein in 1932, and by the time of his death his FBI file was 1,427 pages long.Einstein was deeply impressed by Mahatma Gandhi.He exchanged written letters with Gandhi, and called him "a role model for the generations to come" in a letter writing about him.Einstein spoke of his spiritual outlook in a wide array of original writings and interviews.Einstein stated that he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic God of Baruch Spinoza's philosophy.He did not believe in a personal God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naïve.He clarified, however, that "I am not an atheist", preferring to call himself an agnostic, or a "deeply religious nonbeliever".When asked if he believed in an afterlife, Einstein replied, "No.And one life is enough for me."Einstein was primarily affiliated with non-religious humanist and Ethical Culture groups in both the UK and US.He served on the advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York, and was an honorary associate of the Rationalist Association, which publishes New Humanist in Britain.For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism.He observed, "Without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity."In a one-and-a-half-page hand-written German-language letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind, dated Princeton, 3 January 1954, fifteen months before his death, Einstein wrote: "The word God is for me nothing but the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of venerable but still rather primitive legends.No interpretation, no matter how subtle, can (for me) change anything about this.[...] For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstition.[...] I cannot see anything 'chosen' about them [the Jewish people]."-- -- -- Death  -- -- --
On 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948.He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the State of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live long enough to complete it.Einstein refused surgery, saying, "I want to go when I want.It is tasteless to prolong life artificially.I have done my share; it is time to go.I will do it elegantly."He died in Princeton Hospital early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end.During the autopsy, the pathologist of Princeton Hospital, Thomas Stoltz Harvey, removed Einstein's brain for preservation without the permission of his family, in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent.Einstein's remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.In a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965, at UNESCO headquarters, nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer summarized his impression of Einstein as a person: "He was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness ...There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn."-- -- Scientific career  -- --
Throughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles.He published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific ones.
==========
On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the release of Einstein's papers, comprising more than 30,000 unique documents.Einstein's intellectual achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".In addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the Bose–Einstein statistics, the Einstein refrigerator and others.-- -- -- 1905 – Annus Mirabilis papers  -- -- --

The Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to quantum theory), Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E  -- mc2 that Einstein published in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal in 1905.These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, and matter.The four papers are:


 -- -- -- Statistical mechanics  -- -- --


 -- -- -- -- Thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics  -- -- -- --

Einstein's first paper submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction.It was published in 1901 with the title "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen", which translates as "Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena".Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view.These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist.His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.-- -- -- -- Theory of critical opalescence  -- -- -- --

Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point.Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density.At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations.The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white.Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.-- -- -- Special relativity  -- -- --

Einstein's "Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper" ("On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year.It reconciled conflicts between Maxwell's equations (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics.Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light).The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity.This paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down, and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion.This paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.In his paper on mass–energy equivalence, Einstein produced E  -- mc2 as a consequence of his special relativity equations.Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with Max Planck.Einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies).In 1908, Hermann Minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime.Einstein adopted Minkowski's formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity.-- -- -- General relativity  -- -- --


 -- -- -- -- General relativity and the equivalence principle  -- -- -- --

General relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915.According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses.
==========
General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics.It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.As Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity.In that article titled "On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It", he argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply.This argument is called the equivalence principle.In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation, gravitational redshift and deflection of light.In 1911, Einstein published another article "On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies.Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.-- -- -- -- Gravitational waves  -- -- -- --
In 1916, Einstein predicted gravitational waves, ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation.The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it.By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.The first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16.The explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves.Einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves, detected on Earth on 14 September 2015, exactly one hundred years after the prediction.-- -- -- -- Hole argument and Entwurf theory  -- -- -- --

While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory.He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible.He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations, and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.In June 1913, the Entwurf ('draft') theory was the result of these investigations.As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions.After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915.-- -- -- -- Physical cosmology  -- -- -- --

In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole.He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding.As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe.The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years.This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.Following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by Edwin Hubble in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, The Friedmann-Einstein universe of 1931 and the Einstein–de Sitter universe of 1932.In each of these models, Einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was "in any case theoretically unsatisfactory".In many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his "biggest blunder".The astrophysicist Mario Livio has recently cast doubt on this claim, suggesting that it may be exaggerated.In late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist Cormac O'Raifeartaigh discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble's observations of the recession of the nebulae, Einstein considered a steady-state model of the universe.
==========
In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process he associated with the cosmological constant.As he stated in the paper, "In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel's [sic] facts, and in which the density is constant over time" ... "If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it.For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space."It thus appears that Einstein considered a steady-state model of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold.However, Einstein's steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.-- -- -- -- Energy momentum pseudotensor  -- -- -- --

General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum.Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry.The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.Einstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates.He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field.This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin Schrödinger and others.-- -- -- -- Wormholes  -- -- -- --

In 1935, Einstein collaborated with Nathan Rosen to produce a model of a wormhole, often called Einstein–Rosen bridges.His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper "Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?".These solutions cut and pasted Schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches.If one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged.These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.-- -- -- -- Einstein–Cartan theory  -- -- -- --

In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion.This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.-- -- -- -- Equations of motion  -- -- -- --

The theory of general relativity has a fundamental law—the Einstein field equations, which describe how space curves.The geodesic equation, which describes how particles move, may be derived from the Einstein field equations.Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law.So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.This was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by Roy Kerr for spinning objects.-- -- -- Old quantum theory  -- -- --


 -- -- -- -- Photons and energy quanta  -- -- -- --

In a 1905 paper, Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta).Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr.This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering.Einstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck's constant.
==========
He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave.But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.-- -- -- -- Quantized atomic vibrations  -- -- -- --

In 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator.In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator.Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics.Peter Debye refined this model.-- -- -- -- Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables  -- -- -- --

Throughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems.After Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the periodic table of the elements.Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made.Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process.Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant.Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.-- -- -- -- Bose–Einstein statistics  -- -- -- --

In 1924, Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles.Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik.Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder.Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons.Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.-- -- -- -- Wave–particle duality  -- -- -- --

Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia.In 1908, he became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern.In "Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung" ("The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation"), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles.This paper introduced the photon concept (although the name photon was introduced later by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1926) and inspired the notion of wave–particle duality in quantum mechanics.Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.-- -- -- -- Zero-point energy  -- -- -- --

In a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his "second quantum theory".Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern.Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data.The numbers matched nicely.
==========
However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy.-- -- -- -- Stimulated emission  -- -- -- --

In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser.This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode.This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.-- -- -- -- Matter waves  -- -- -- --

Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first.In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton–Jacobi equation of mechanics.This paper would inspire Schrödinger's work of 1926.-- -- -- Quantum mechanics  -- -- --


 -- -- -- -- Einstein's objections to quantum mechanics  -- -- -- --

Einstein was displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925.Contrary to popular belief, his doubts were not due to a conviction that God "is not playing at dice".Indeed, it was Einstein himself, in his 1917 paper that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, who first proposed the fundamental role of chance in explaining quantum processes.Rather, he objected to what quantum mechanics implies about the nature of reality.Einstein believed that a physical reality exists independent of our ability to observe it.In contrast, Bohr and his followers maintained that all we can know are the results of measurements and observations, and that it makes no sense to speculate about an ultimate reality that exists beyond our perceptions.-- -- -- -- Bohr versus Einstein  -- -- -- --

 The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Einstein and Niels Bohr, who were two of its founders.Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science.Their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics.-- -- -- -- Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox  -- -- -- --

In 1935, Einstein returned quantum mechanics, in particular to the question of its completeness, in the "EPR paper".In a thought experiment, he considered two particles which had interacted such that their properties were strongly correlated.No matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle; likewise a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way.Given Einstein's concept of local realism, there were two possibilities: (1) either the other particle had these properties already determined, or (2) the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle.Einstein rejected this second possibility (popularly called "spooky action at a distance").Einstein's belief in local realism led him to assert that, while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question, it must be incomplete.But as a physical principle, local realism was shown to be incorrect when the Aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed Bell's theorem, which J. S. Bell had delineated in 1964.The results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which "particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities, each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated."Although Einstein was wrong about local realism, his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite, entangled quantum states, has resulted in the EPR paper becoming among the top ten papers published in Physical Review.It is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory.-- -- -- Unified field theory  -- -- --

Following his research on general relativity, Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity.In 1950, he described his "unified field theory" in a Scientific American article titled "On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation".Although he continued to be lauded for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.
==========
In his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces, which were not well understood until many years after his death.Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification.Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.-- -- -- Other investigations  -- -- --

Einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned.These pertain to force, superconductivity, and other research.-- -- -- Collaboration with other scientists  -- -- --

In addition to longtime collaborators Leopold Infeld, Nathan Rosen, Peter Bergmann and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.-- -- -- -- Einstein–de Haas experiment  -- -- -- --

Einstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin.In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum.They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes.This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.-- -- -- -- Schrödinger gas model  -- -- -- --
Einstein suggested to Erwin Schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a Bose–Einstein gas by considering a box.Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator.Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.This formulation is a form of second quantization, but it predates modern quantum mechanics.Erwin Schrödinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas.Schrödinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.-- -- -- -- Einstein refrigerator  -- -- -- --

In 1926, Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the Einstein refrigerator.This absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input.On 11 November 1930, U.S. Patent 1,781,541 was awarded to Einstein and Leó Szilárd for the refrigerator.Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company Electrolux.-- -- Non-scientific legacy  -- --
While traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse.The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to The Hebrew University.Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986).Einstein had expressed his interest in the plumbing profession and was made an honorary member of the Plumbers and Steamfitters Union.Barbara Wolff, of The Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.Corbis, successor to The Roger Richman Agency, licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the university.-- -- In popular culture  -- --

In the period before World War II, The New Yorker published a vignette in their "The Talk of the Town" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain "that theory".He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries.
==========
Aesthetics, or esthetics () : is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of art, beauty and taste, with the creation or appreciation of beauty : a particular theory or conception of beauty or art : a particular taste for or approach to what is pleasing to the senses and especially sight.In its more technical epistemological perspective, it is defined as the study of subjective and sensori-emotional values, or sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste.Aesthetics studies how artists imagine, create and perform works of art; how people use, enjoy, and criticize art; and what happens in their minds when they look at paintings, listen to music, or read poetry, and understand what they see and hear.It also studies how they feel about art, why they like some works and not others, and how art can affect their moods, beliefs, and attitude toward life.More broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics as "critical reflection on art, culture and nature".In modern English, the term aesthetic can also refer to a set of principles underlying the works of a particular art movement or theory: one speaks, for example, of the Cubist aesthetic.-- -- Etymology  -- --
The word aesthetic is derived from the Greek αἰσθητικός (aisthetikos, meaning "esthetic, sensitive, sentient, pertaining to sense perception"), which in turn was derived from αἰσθάνομαι (aisthanomai, meaning "I perceive, feel, sense" and related to αἴσθησις (aisthēsis, "sensation").Aesthetics in this central sense has been said to start with the series of articles on “The Pleasures of the Imagination” which the journalist Joseph Addison wrote in the early issues of the magazine The Spectator in 1712.The term "aesthetics" was appropriated and coined with new meaning by the German philosopher Alexander Baumgarten in his dissertation Meditationes philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema pertinentibus ("Philosophical considerations of some matters pertaining the poem") in 1735;  Baumgarten chose "aesthetics" because he wished to emphasize the experience of art as a means of knowing.Aesthetics, a not very tidy intellectual discipline, is a heterogeneous collection of problems that concern the arts primarily but also relate to nature.even though his later definition in the fragment Aesthetica (1750) is more often referred to as the first definition of modern aesthetics.-- -- Aesthetics and the philosophy of art  -- --
Aesthetics is for the artist as Ornithology is for the birds.Some separate aesthetics and philosophy of art, claiming that the former is the study of beauty while the latter is the study of works of art.However, most commonly Aesthetics encompasses both questions around beauty as well as questions about art.It examines topics such as aesthetic objects,  aesthetic experience, and aesthetic judgments.For some, aesthetics is considered a synonym for the philosophy of art since Hegel, while others insist that there is a significant distinction between these closely related fields.In practice, aesthetic judgement refers to the sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object (not necessarily an art object), while artistic judgement refers to the recognition, appreciation or criticism of art or an art work.Philosophical aesthetics not only has to speak about art and to produce judgments about art works, but also has to give a definition of what art is.Art is an autonomous entity for philosophy, because art deals with the senses (i.e.the etymology of aesthetics) and art is as such free of any moral or political purpose.Hence, there are two different conceptions of art in aesthetics: art as knowledge or art as action, but aesthetics is neither epistemology nor ethics.Aestheticians compare historical developments with theoretical approaches to the arts of many periods.They study the varieties of art in relation to their physical, social, and culture environments.Aestheticians also use psychology to understand how people see, hear, imagine, think, learn, and act in relation to the materials and problems of art.Aesthetic psychology studies the creative process and the aesthetic experience.-- -- Aesthetic judgment, universals and ethics  -- --


 -- -- -- Aesthetic judgment  -- -- --
Aesthetics examines our affective domain response to an object or phenomenon.Judgments of aesthetic value rely on our ability to discriminate at a sensory level.However, aesthetic judgments usually go beyond sensory discrimination.
==========
For David Hume, delicacy of taste is not merely "the ability to detect all the ingredients in a composition", but also our sensitivity "to pains as well as pleasures, which escape the rest of mankind."Thus, the sensory discrimination is linked to capacity for pleasure.For Immanuel Kant  (Critique of Judgment, 1790), "enjoyment" is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but judging something to be "beautiful" has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our capacities of reflective contemplation.Judgments of beauty are sensory, emotional and intellectual all at once.Kant (1790) observed of a man "If he says that canary wine is agreeable he is quite content if someone else corrects his terms and reminds him to say instead: It is agreeable to me," because "Everyone has his own (sense of) taste".The case of "beauty" is different from mere "agreeableness" because, "If he proclaims something to be beautiful, then he requires the same liking from others; he then judges not just for himself but for everyone, and speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things."Viewer interpretations of beauty may on occasion be observed to possess two concepts of value: aesthetics and taste.Aesthetics is the philosophical notion of beauty.Taste is a result of an education process and awareness of elite cultural values learned through exposure to mass culture.Bourdieu examined how the elite in society define the aesthetic values like taste and how varying levels of exposure to these values can result in variations by class, cultural background, and education.According to Kant, beauty is subjective and universal; thus certain things are beautiful to everyone.In the opinion of Władysław Tatarkiewicz, there are six conditions for the presentation of art: beauty, form, representation, reproduction of reality, artistic expression and innovation.However, one may not be able to pin down these qualities in a work of art.-- -- -- -- Factors involved in aesthetic judgment  -- -- -- --

Judgments of aesthetical values seem often to involve many other kinds of issues as well.Responses such as disgust show that sensory detection is linked in instinctual ways to facial expressions, and even behaviours like the gag reflex.Yet disgust can often be a learned or cultural issue too; as Darwin pointed out, seeing a stripe of soup in a man's beard is disgusting even though neither soup nor beards are themselves disgusting.Aesthetic judgments may be linked to emotions or, like emotions, partially embodied in our physical reactions.For example, the awe inspired by a sublime landscape might physically manifest with an increased heart-rate or pupil dilation; physiological reaction may express or even cause the initial awe.As seen, emotions are conformed to 'cultural' reactions, therefore aesthetics is always characterized by 'regional responses', as Francis Grose was the first to affirm in his ‘Rules for Drawing Caricaturas: With an Essay on Comic Painting’ (1788), published in W. Hogarth, The Analysis of Beauty, Bagster, London s.d.(1791?[1753]), pp.1–24.Francis Grose can therefore be claimed to be the first critical 'aesthetic regionalist' in proclaiming the anti-universality of aesthetics in contrast to the perilous and always resurgent dictatorship of beauty.'Aesthetic Regionalism' can thus be seen as a political statement and stance which vies against any universal notion of beauty to safeguard the counter-tradition of aesthetics related to what has usually been considered and dubbed un-beautiful just because one's culture does not contemplate it, e.g.
==========
E. Burke's sublime, what is usually defined as 'primitive' art, or un-harmonious, non-cathartic art, camp art, which 'beauty' posits and creates, dichotomously, as its opposite, without even the need of formal statements, but which will be 'perceived' as ugly.Likewise, aesthetic judgments may be culturally conditioned to some extent.Victorians in Britain often saw African sculpture as ugly, but just a few decades later, Edwardian audiences saw the same sculptures as being beautiful.Evaluations of beauty may well be linked to desirability, perhaps even to sexual desirability.Thus, judgments of aesthetic value can become linked to judgments of economic, political, or moral value.In a current context, one might judge a Lamborghini to be beautiful partly because it is desirable as a status symbol, or we might judge it to be repulsive partly because it signifies for us over-consumption and offends our political or moral values.Aesthetic judgments can often be very fine-grained and internally contradictory.Likewise aesthetic judgments seem often to be at least partly intellectual and interpretative.It is what a thing means or symbolizes for us that is often what we are judging.Modern aestheticians have asserted that will and desire were almost dormant in aesthetic experience, yet preference and choice have seemed important aesthetics to some 20th-century thinkers.The point is already made by Hume, but see Mary Mothersill, "Beauty and the Critic's Judgment", in The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics, 2004.Thus aesthetic judgments might be seen to be based on the senses, emotions, intellectual opinions, will, desires, culture, preferences, values, subconscious behaviour, conscious decision, training, instinct, sociological institutions, or some complex combination of these, depending on exactly which theory one employs.A third major topic in the study of aesthetic judgments is how they are unified across art forms.For instance, the source of a painting's beauty has a different character to that of beautiful music, suggesting their aesthetics differ in kind.The distinct inability of language to express aesthetic judgment and the role of Social construction further cloud this issue.-- -- -- Aesthetic universals  -- -- --
The philosopher Denis Dutton identified six universal signatures in human aesthetics:
Expertise or virtuosity.Humans cultivate, recognize, and admire technical artistic skills.Nonutilitarian pleasure.People enjoy art for art's sake, and do not demand that it keep them warm or put food on the table.Style.Artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in a recognizable style.Criticism.People make a point of judging, appreciating, and interpreting works of art.Imitation.With a few important exceptions like abstract painting, works of art simulate experiences of the world.
==========
Special focus.Art is set aside from ordinary life and made a dramatic focus of experience.Artists such as Thomas Hirschhorn have indicated that there are too many exceptions to Dutton's categories.For example, Hirschhorn's installations deliberately eschew technical virtuosity.People can appreciate a Renaissance Madonna for aesthetic reasons, but such objects often had (and sometimes still have) specific devotional functions."Rules of composition" that might be read into Duchamp's Fountain or John Cage's 4′33″ do not locate the works in a recognizable style (or certainly not a style recognizable at the time of the works' realization).Moreover, some of Dutton's categories seem too broad: a physicist might entertain hypothetical worlds in his/her imagination in the course of formulating a theory.Another problem is that Dutton's categories seek to universalize traditional European notions of aesthetics and art forgetting that, as André Malraux and others have pointed out, there have been large numbers of cultures in which such ideas (including the idea "art" itself) were non-existent.-- -- -- Aesthetic ethics  -- -- --
Aesthetic ethics refers to the idea that human conduct and behaviour ought to be governed by that which is beautiful and attractive.John Dewey has pointed out that the unity of aesthetics and ethics is in fact reflected in our understanding of behaviour being "fair"—the word having a double meaning of attractive and morally acceptable.More recently, James Page has suggested that aesthetic ethics might be taken to form a philosophical rationale for peace education.-- -- New Criticism and "The Intentional Fallacy"  -- --
During the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other.This resulted in the rise of the New Criticism school and debate concerning the intentional fallacy.At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.In 1946, William K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "The Intentional Fallacy", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an author's intention, or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work.For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.In another essay, "The Affective Fallacy," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text.This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the reader-response school of literary theory.One of the leading theorists from this school, Stanley Fish, was himself trained by New Critics.Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).As summarized by Berys Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms' assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic."These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art.So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works."They quote Richard Wollheim as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."-- -- Derivative forms of aesthetics  -- --
A large number of derivative forms of aesthetics have developed as contemporary and transitory forms of inquiry associated with the field of aesthetics which include the post-modern, psychoanalytic, scientific, and mathematical among others.

-- -- -- Post-modern aesthetics and psychoanalysis  -- -- --

Early-twentieth-century artists, poets and composers challenged existing notions of beauty, broadening the scope of art and aesthetics.In 1941, Eli Siegel, American philosopher and poet, founded Aesthetic Realism, the philosophy that reality itself is aesthetic, and that "The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites."Various attempts have been made to define Post-Modern Aesthetics.The challenge to the assumption that beauty was central to art and aesthetics, thought to be original, is actually continuous with older aesthetic theory; Aristotle was the first in the Western tradition to classify "beauty" into types as in his theory of drama, and Kant made a distinction between beauty and the sublime.What was new was a refusal to credit the higher status of certain types, where the taxonomy implied a preference for tragedy and the sublime to comedy and the Rococo.Croce suggested that "expression" is central in the way that beauty was once thought to be central.George Dickie suggested that the sociological institutions of the art world were the glue binding art and sensibility into unities.Marshall McLuhan suggested that art always functions as a "counter-environment" designed to make visible what is usually invisible about a society.Theodor Adorno felt that aesthetics could not proceed without confronting the role of the culture industry in the commodification of art and aesthetic experience.Hal Foster attempted to portray the reaction against beauty and Modernist art in The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture.Arthur Danto has described this reaction as "kalliphobia" (after the Greek word for beauty, κάλλος kallos).André Malraux explains that the notion of beauty was connected to a particular conception of art that arose with the Renaissance and was still dominant in the eighteenth century (but was supplanted later).The discipline of aesthetics, which originated in the eighteenth century, mistook this transient state of affairs for a revelation of the permanent nature of art.Brian Massumi suggests to reconsider beauty following the aesthetical thought in the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari.Walter Benjamin echoed Malraux in believing aesthetics was a comparatively recent invention, a view proven wrong in the late 1970s, when Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake analyzed links between beauty, information processing, and information theory.Denis Dutton in "The Art Instinct" also proposed that an aesthetic sense was a vital evolutionary factor.Jean-François Lyotard re-invokes the Kantian distinction between taste and the sublime.Sublime painting, unlike kitsch realism, "... will enable us to see only by making it impossible to see; it will please only by causing pain."Sigmund Freud inaugurated aesthetical thinking in Psychoanalysis mainly via the "Uncanny" as aesthetical affect.Following Freud and Merleau-Ponty, Jacques Lacan theorized aesthetics in terms of sublimation and the Thing.The relation of Marxist aesthetics to post-modern aesthetics is still a contentious area of debate.-- -- -- Recent aesthetics  -- -- --
Guy Sircello has pioneered efforts in analytic philosophy to develop a rigorous theory of aesthetics, focusing on the concepts of beauty, love and sublimity.In contrast to romantic theorists Sircello argued for the objectivity of beauty and formulated a theory of love on that basis.British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art aesthetics, Peter Osborne, makes the point that "'post-conceptual art' aesthetic does not concern a particular type of contemporary art so much as the historical-ontological condition for the production of contemporary art in general ...".Osborne noted that contemporary art is 'post-conceptual' in a public lecture delivered in 2010.
==========
Gary Tedman has put forward a theory of a subjectless aesthetics derived from Karl Marx's concept of alienation, and Louis Althusser's antihumanism, using elements of Freud's group psychology, defining a concept of the 'aesthetic level of practice'.Gregory Loewen has suggested that the subject is key in the interaction with the aesthetic object.The work of art serves as a vehicle for the projection of the individual's identity into the world of objects, as well as being the irruptive source of much of what is uncanny in modern life.As well, art is used to memorialize individuated biographies in a manner that allows persons to imagine that they are part of something greater than themselves.-- -- -- Aesthetics and science  -- -- --

The field of experimental aesthetics was founded by Gustav Theodor Fechner in the 19th century.Experimental aesthetics in these times had been characterized by a subject-based, inductive approach.The analysis of individual experience and behaviour based on experimental methods is a central part of experimental aesthetics.In particular, the perception of works of art, music, or modern items such as websites or other IT products is studied.Experimental aesthetics is strongly oriented towards the natural sciences.Modern approaches mostly come from the fields of cognitive psychology or neuroscience (neuroaesthetics).In the 1970s, Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake were among the first to analyze links between aesthetics, information processing, and information theory.In the 1990s, Jürgen Schmidhuber described an algorithmic theory of beauty which takes the subjectivity of the observer into account and postulates: among several observations classified as comparable by a given subjective observer, the aesthetically most pleasing one is the one with the shortest description, given the observer's previous knowledge and his particular method for encoding the data.This is closely related to the principles of algorithmic information theory and minimum description length.One of his examples: mathematicians enjoy simple proofs with a short description in their formal language.Another very concrete example describes an aesthetically pleasing human face whose proportions can be described by very few bits of information, drawing inspiration from less detailed 15th century proportion studies by Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Dürer.Schmidhuber's theory explicitly distinguishes between what's beautiful and what's interesting, stating that interestingness corresponds to the first derivative of subjectively perceived beauty.Here the premise is that any observer continually tries to improve the predictability and compressibility of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and symmetries and fractal self-similarity.Whenever the observer's learning process (which may be a predictive artificial neural network; see also Neuroesthetics) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer bits than before, the temporary interestingness of the data corresponds to the number of saved bits.This compression progress is proportional to the observer's internal reward, also called curiosity reward.A reinforcement learning algorithm is used to maximize future expected reward by learning to execute action sequences that cause additional interesting input data with yet unknown but learnable predictability or regularity.The principles can be implemented on artificial agents which then exhibit a form of artificial curiosity.-- -- -- Truth in beauty and mathematics  -- -- --
Mathematical considerations, such as symmetry and complexity, are used for analysis in theoretical aesthetics.This is different from the aesthetic considerations of applied aesthetics used in the study of mathematical beauty.Aesthetic considerations such as symmetry and simplicity are used in areas of philosophy, such as ethics and theoretical physics and cosmology to define truth, outside of empirical considerations.Beauty and Truth have been argued to be nearly synonymous, as reflected in the statement "Beauty is truth, truth beauty" in the poem Ode on a Grecian Urn by John Keats, or by the Hindu motto "Satyam Shivam Sundaram" (Satya (Truth) is Shiva (God), and Shiva is Sundaram (Beautiful)).The fact that judgments of beauty and judgments of truth both are influenced by processing fluency, which is the ease with which information can be processed, has been presented as an explanation for why beauty is sometimes equated with truth.

In music, an accent is an emphasis, stress, or stronger attack placed on a particular note or set of notes, or chord, either as a result of its context or specifically indicated by an accent mark.Accents contribute to the articulation and prosody of a performance of a musical phrase.Accents may be written into a score or part by a composer or added by the performer as part of his or her interpretation of a musical piece.By default, in the music notation program Sibelius, "accents boost the dynamic by 50%."Compared to surrounding notes:

A dynamic accent or stress accent is an emphasis using louder sound or a stronger articulation, typically most pronounced on the attack of the sound.A tonic accent is an emphasis on notes by virtue of being higher in pitch as opposed to higher in volume.An agogic accent is an emphasis by virtue of being longer in duration.Accents which do not correspond to the stressed beats of the prevailing meter are said to be syncopated.For example, in common time, also called 4/4, the most common metre in popular music, the stressed beats are one and three.If chords or notes are played on beats two or four, this creates syncopation, as the music is emphasizing the "weak" beats of the bar.Syncopation is used in Classical music, popular music and traditional music.However, it is more prominent in blues, jazz, funk, disco and Latin music.-- -- Agogic  -- --
There are four kinds of agogic accents :

Longer notated duration of a note, for example, a whole note/semibreve (four beats in common time) among quarter notes/crotchets (each of which gets one beat).Extended duration of a note within its full-time value (without altering the tempo).For example, players of organ and harpsichord (which do not allow the use of dynamic accents) can emphasize one of a sequence of staccato quarter notes by making it less staccato (that is, making one note longer to emphasize it).Extended duration of a note with the effect of temporarily slowing down the tempo (rubato or rallentando).Delayed onset of a note, for example by doing a pause before starting a note.-- -- Marks  -- --
In music notation, an accent mark indicates a louder dynamic and a stronger attack to apply to a single note or an articulation mark.From left to right, the meanings of these articulation marks are explained below:

The most common symbol is the horizontal wedge, the first symbol in the diagram above.This is the symbol that most musicians mean when they say accent mark.It indicates that the marked note should have an emphasized beginning and then taper off rather quickly.

Acoustics is the branch of physics that deals with the study of all mechanical waves in gases, liquids, and solids including topics such as vibration, sound, ultrasound and infrasound.A scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an acoustician while someone working in the field of acoustics technology may be called an acoustical engineer.The application of acoustics is present in almost all aspects of modern society with the most obvious being the audio and noise control industries.Hearing is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world, and speech is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and culture.Accordingly, the science of acoustics spreads across many facets of human society—music, medicine, architecture, industrial production, warfare and more.Likewise, animal species such as songbirds and frogs use sound and hearing as a key element of mating rituals or marking territories.Art, craft, science and technology have provoked one another to advance the whole, as in many other fields of knowledge.Robert Bruce Lindsay's 'Wheel of Acoustics' is a well accepted overview of the various fields in acoustics.Acoustic music is a genre of music using instruments that produce sound solely through acoustic means, without electronic amplification.-- -- History  -- --

The word "acoustic" is derived from the Greek word ἀκουστικός (akoustikos), meaning "of or for hearing, ready to hear"and that from ἀκουστός (akoustos), "heard, audible", which in turn derives from the verb ἀκούω(akouo), "I hear".The Latin synonym is "sonic", after which the term sonics used to be a synonym for acoustics and later a branch of acoustics.Frequencies above and below the audible range are called "ultrasonic" and "infrasonic", respectively.-- -- -- Early research in acoustics  -- -- --

In the 6th century BC, the ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras wanted to know why some  combinations of musical sounds seemed more beautiful than others, and he found answers in terms of numerical ratios representing the harmonic overtone series on a string.He is reputed to have observed that when the lengths of vibrating strings are expressible as ratios of integers (e.g.2 to 3, 3 to 4), the tones produced will be harmonious, and the smaller the integers the more harmonious the sounds.If, for example, a string of a certain length would sound particularly harmonious with a string of twice the length (other factors being equal).In modern parlance, if a string sounds the note C when plucked, a string twice as long will sound a C an octave lower.In one system of musical tuning, the tones in between are then given by 16:9 for D, 8:5 for E, 3:2 for F, 4:3 for G, 6:5 for A, and 16:15 for B, in ascending order.Aristotle (384–322 BC) understood that sound consisted of compressions and rarefactions of air which "falls upon and strikes the air which is next to it...", a very good expression of the nature of wave motion.In about 20 BC, the Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius wrote a treatise on the acoustic properties of theaters including discussion of interference, echoes, and reverberation—the beginnings of architectural acoustics.In Book V of his De architectura (The Ten Books of Architecture) Vitruvius describes sound as a wave comparable to a water wave extended to three dimensions, which, when interrupted by obstructions, would flow back and break up following waves.He described the ascending seats in ancient theaters as designed to prevent this deterioration of sound and also recommended bronze vessels of appropriate sizes be placed in theaters to resonate with the fourth, fifth and so on, up to the double octave, in order to resonate with the more desirable, harmonious notes.During the Islamic golden age, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī (973-1048) is believed to postulated that the speed of sound was much slower than the speed of light.The physical understanding of acoustical processes advanced rapidly during and after the Scientific Revolution.Mainly Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) but also Marin Mersenne (1588–1648), independently, discovered the complete laws of vibrating strings (completing what Pythagoras and Pythagoreans had started 2000 years earlier).Galileo wrote "Waves are produced by the vibrations of a sonorous body, which spread through the air, bringing to the tympanum of the ear a stimulus which the mind interprets as sound", a remarkable statement that points to the beginnings of physiological and psychological acoustics.Experimental measurements of the speed of sound in air were carried out successfully between 1630 and 1680 by a number of investigators, prominently Mersenne.

Meanwhile, Newton (1642–1727) derived the relationship for wave velocity in solids, a cornerstone of physical acoustics (Principia, 1687).-- -- -- Age of Enlightenment and onward  -- -- --
The eighteenth century saw major advances in acoustics as mathematicians applied the new techniques of calculus to elaborate theories of sound wave propagation.In the nineteenth century the major figures of mathematical acoustics were Helmholtz in Germany, who consolidated the field of physiological acoustics, and Lord Rayleigh in England, who combined the previous knowledge with his own copious contributions to the field in his monumental work The Theory of Sound (1877).Also in the 19th century, Wheatstone, Ohm, and Henry developed the analogy between electricity and acoustics.The twentieth century saw a burgeoning of technological applications of the large body of scientific knowledge that was by then in place.The first such application was Sabine’s groundbreaking work in architectural acoustics, and many others followed.Underwater acoustics was used for detecting submarines in the first World War.Sound recording and the telephone played important roles in a global transformation of society.Sound measurement and analysis reached new levels of accuracy and sophistication through the use of electronics and computing.The ultrasonic frequency range enabled wholly new kinds of application in medicine and industry.New kinds of transducers (generators and receivers of acoustic energy) were invented and put to use.-- -- Fundamental concepts of acoustics  -- --


 -- -- -- Definition  -- -- --
Acoustics is defined by ANSI/ASA S1.1-2013 as "(a) Science of sound, including its production, transmission, and effects, including biological and psychological effects.(b) Those qualities of a room that, together, determine its character with respect to auditory effects."The study of acoustics revolves around the generation, propagation and reception of mechanical waves and vibrations.The steps shown in the above diagram can be found in any acoustical event or process.There are many kinds of cause, both natural and volitional.There are many kinds of transduction process that convert energy from some other form into sonic energy, producing a sound wave.There is one fundamental equation that describes sound wave propagation, the acoustic wave equation, but the phenomena that emerge from it are varied and often complex.The wave carries energy throughout the propagating medium.Eventually this energy is transduced again into other forms, in ways that again may be natural and/or volitionally contrived.The final effect may be purely physical or it may reach far into the biological or volitional domains.The five basic steps are found equally well whether we are talking about an earthquake, a submarine using sonar to locate its foe, or a band playing in a rock concert.The central stage in the acoustical process is wave propagation.This falls within the domain of physical acoustics.
==========
In fluids, sound propagates primarily as a pressure wave.In solids, mechanical waves can take many forms including longitudinal waves, transverse waves and surface waves.Acoustics looks first at the pressure levels and frequencies in the sound wave and how the wave interacts with the environment.This interaction can be described as either a diffraction, interference or a reflection or a mix of the three.If several media are present, a refraction can also occur.Transduction processes are also of special importance to acoustics.-- -- -- Wave propagation: pressure levels  -- -- --

In fluids such as air and water, sound waves propagate as disturbances in the ambient pressure level.While this disturbance is usually small, it is still noticeable to the human ear.The smallest sound that a person can hear, known as the threshold of hearing, is nine orders of magnitude smaller than the ambient pressure.The loudness of these disturbances is related to the sound pressure level (SPL) which is measured on a logarithmic scale in decibels.-- -- -- Wave propagation: frequency  -- -- --
Physicists and acoustic engineers tend to discuss sound pressure levels in terms of frequencies, partly because this is how our ears interpret sound.What we experience as "higher pitched" or "lower pitched" sounds are pressure vibrations having a higher or lower number of cycles per second.In a common technique of acoustic measurement, acoustic signals are sampled in time, and then presented in more meaningful forms such as octave bands or time frequency plots.Both of these popular methods are used to analyze sound and better understand the acoustic phenomenon.The entire spectrum can be divided into three sections:  audio, ultrasonic, and infrasonic.The audio range falls between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz.This range is important because its frequencies can be detected by the human ear.This range has a number of applications, including speech communication and music.The ultrasonic range refers to the very high frequencies: 20,000 Hz and higher.This range has shorter wavelengths which allow better resolution in imaging technologies.Medical applications such as ultrasonography and elastography rely on the ultrasonic frequency range.On the other end of the spectrum, the lowest frequencies are known as the infrasonic range.These frequencies can be used to study geological phenomena such as earthquakes.Analytic instruments such as the spectrum analyzer facilitate visualization and measurement of acoustic signals and their properties.
==========
The spectrogram produced by such an instrument is a graphical display of the time varying pressure level and frequency profiles which give a specific acoustic signal its defining character.-- -- -- Transduction in acoustics  -- -- --

A transducer is a device for converting one form of energy into another.In an electroacoustic context, this means converting sound energy into electrical energy (or vice versa).Electroacoustic transducers include loudspeakers, microphones, hydrophones and sonar projectors.These devices convert a sound pressure wave to or from an electric signal.The most widely used transduction principles are electromagnetism, electrostatics and piezoelectricity.The transducers in most common loudspeakers (e.g.woofers and tweeters), are electromagnetic  devices that generate waves using a suspended diaphragm driven by an electromagnetic voice coil, sending off pressure waves.Electret microphones and condenser microphones employ electrostatics—as the sound wave strikes the microphone's diaphragm, it moves and induces a voltage change.The ultrasonic systems used in medical ultrasonography employ piezoelectric transducers.These are made from special ceramics in which mechanical vibrations and electrical fields are interlinked through a property of the material itself.-- -- Acoustician  -- --
An acoustician is an expert in the science of sound.-- -- -- Education  -- -- --
There are many types of acoustician, but they usually have a Bachelor's degree or higher qualification.Some possess a degree in acoustics, while others enter the discipline via studies in fields such as physics or engineering.Much work in acoustics requires a good grounding in Mathematics and science.Many acoustic scientists work in research and development.Some conduct basic research to advance our knowledge of the perception (e.g.hearing, psychoacoustics or neurophysiology) of speech, music and noise.Other acoustic scientists advance understanding of how sound is affected as it moves through environments, e.g.Underwater acoustics, Architectural acoustics or Structural acoustics.Other areas of work are listed under subdisciplines below.Acoustic scientists work in government, university and private industry laboratories.Many go on to work in Acoustical Engineering.Some positions, such as Faculty (academic staff) require a Doctor of Philosophy.

-- -- Subdisciplines  -- --
These subdisciplines are a slightly modified list from the PACS (Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme) coding used by the Acoustical Society of America.-- -- -- Archaeoacoustics  -- -- --

Archaeoacoustics, also known as the archaeology of sound, is one of the only ways to experience the past with senses other than our eyes.Archaeoacoustics is studied by testing the acoustic properties of prehistoric sites, including caves.Iegor Rezkinoff, a sound archaeologist, studies the acoustic properties of caves through natural sounds like humming and whistling.Archaeological theories of acoustics are focused around ritualistic purposes as well as a way of echolocation in the caves.In archaeology, acoustic sounds and rituals directly correlate as specific sounds were meant to bring ritual participants closer to a spiritual awakening.Parallels can also be drawn between cave wall paintings and the acoustic properties of the cave; they are both dynamic.Because archaeoacoustics is a fairly new archaeological subject, acoustic sound is still being tested in these prehistoric sites today.-- -- -- Aeroacoustics  -- -- --

Aeroacoustics is the study of noise generated by air movement, for instance via turbulence, and the movement of sound through the fluid air.This knowledge is applied in acoustical engineering to study how to quieten aircraft.Aeroacoustics is important to understanding how wind musical instruments work.-- -- -- Acoustic signal processing  -- -- --

Acoustic signal processing is the electronic manipulation of acoustic signals.Applications include: active noise control; design for hearing aids or cochlear implants; echo cancellation; music information retrieval, and perceptual coding (e.g.MP3 or Opus).-- -- -- Architectural acoustics  -- -- --

Architectural acoustics (also known as building acoustics) involves the scientific understanding of how to achieve good sound within a building.It typically involves the study of speech intelligibility, speech privacy, music quality, and vibration reduction in the built environment.-- -- -- Bioacoustics  -- -- --

Bioacoustics is the scientific study of the hearing and calls of animal calls, as well as how animals are affected by the acoustic and sounds of their habitat.-- -- -- Electroacoustics  -- -- --

This subdiscipline is concerned with the recording, manipulation and reproduction of audio using electronics.This might include products such as mobile phones, large scale public address systems or virtual reality systems in research laboratories.-- -- -- Environmental noise and soundscapes  -- -- --

Environmental acoustics is concerned with noise and vibration caused by railways,  road traffic, aircraft, industrial equipment and recreational activities.The main aim of these studies is to reduce levels of environmental noise and vibration.Research work now also has a focus on the positive use of sound in urban environments: soundscapes and tranquility.-- -- -- Musical acoustics  -- -- --

Musical acoustics is the study of the physics of acoustic instruments; the audio signal processing used in electronic music; the computer analysis of music and composition, and the perception and cognitive neuroscience of music.-- -- -- Psychoacoustics  -- -- --
Many studies have been conducted to identify the relationship between acoustics and cognition, or more commonly known as psychoacoustics, in which what one hears is a combination of perception and biological aspects.
==========
The information intercepted by the passage of sound waves through the ear is understood and interpreted through the brain, emphasizing the connection between the mind and acoustics.Psychological changes have been seen as brain waves slow down or speed up as a result of varying auditory stimulus which can in turn affect the way one thinks, feels, or even behaves.This correlation can be viewed in normal, everyday situations in which listening to an upbeat or uptempo song can cause one's foot to start tapping or a slower song can leave one feeling calm and serene.In a deeper biological look at the phenomenon of psychoacoustics, it was discovered that the central nervous system is activated by basic acoustical characteristics of music.By observing how the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spine, is influenced by acoustics, the pathway in which acoustic affects the mind, and essentially the body, is evident.-- -- -- Speech  -- -- --

Acousticians study the production, processing and perception of speech.Speech recognition and Speech synthesis are two important areas of speech processing using computers.The subject also overlaps with the disciplines of physics, physiology, psychology, and linguistics.-- -- -- Ultrasonics  -- -- --

Ultrasonics deals with sounds at frequencies too high to be heard by humans.Specialisms include medical ultrasonics (including medical ultrasonography), sonochemistry, material characterisation and underwater acoustics (Sonar).-- -- -- Underwater acoustics  -- -- --

Underwater acoustics is the scientific study of natural and man-made sounds underwater.Applications include sonar to locate submarines, underwater communication by whales, climate change monitoring by measuring sea temperatures acoustically, sonic weapons, and marine bioacoustics.-- -- -- Vibration and dynamics  -- -- --

This is the study of how mechanical systems vibrate and interact with their surroundings.Applications might include: ground vibrations from railways; vibration isolation to reduce vibration in operating theatres; studying how vibration can damage health (vibration white finger); vibration control to protect a building from earthquakes, or measuring how structure-borne sound moves through buildings.-- -- Professional societies  -- --

Acrobatics (from Ancient Greek ἀκροβατέω, akrobateo, "walk on tiptoe, strut") is the performance of extraordinary human feats of balance, agility, and motor coordination.It can be found in many of the performing arts, sporting events, and martial arts.Acrobatics is most often associated with activities that make extensive use of gymnastic elements, such as acro dance, circus, and gymnastics, but many other athletic activities — such as ballet and diving — may also employ acrobatics.Although acrobatics is most commonly associated with human body performance, it may also apply to other types of performance, such as aerobatics.-- -- History  -- --

Acrobatic traditions are found in many cultures, and there is evidence that the earliest such traditions occurred thousands of years ago.For example, Minoan art from c. 2000 BC contains depictions of acrobatic feats on the backs of bulls.Ancient Greeks practiced acrobatics, and the noble court displays of the European Middle Ages would often include acrobatic performances that included juggling.In China, acrobatics have been a part of the culture since the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220).Acrobatics were part of village harvest festivals.During the Tang Dynasty, acrobatics saw much the same sort of development as European acrobatics saw during the Middle Ages, with court displays during the 7th through 10th century dominating the practice.Acrobatics continues to be an important part of modern Chinese variety art.Though the term initially applied to tightrope walking, in the 19th century, a form of performance art including circus acts began to use the term as well.In the late 19th century, tumbling and other acrobatic and gymnastic activities became competitive sport in Europe.Acrobatics has often served as a subject for fine art.Examples of this are paintings such as Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg) by Impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir, which depicts two German acrobatic sisters, Pablo Picasso's 1905 Acrobat and Young Harlequin, and Acrobats in a Paris suburb by Viktor Vasnetsov.-- -- Types  -- --

Aesthetics of music () is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of art, beauty and taste in music, and with the creation or appreciation of beauty in music.In the pre-modern tradition, the aesthetics of music or musical aesthetics explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization.In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (plaisir and jouissance) of music.The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to Baumgarten in the 18th century, followed by Kant.Through their writing, the ancient term aesthetics, meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation.In recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment.For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.Aesthetics is a sub-discipline of philosophy.In the 20th century, important contributions to the aesthetics of music were made by Peter Kivy, Jerrold Levinson, Roger Scruton, and Stephen Davies.However, many musicians, music critics, and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music.In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between Eduard Hanslick, a music critic and musicologist, and composer Richard Wagner regarding whether instrumental music could communicate emotions to the listener.Wagner and his disciples argued that instrumental music could communicate emotions and images; composers who held this belief wrote instrumental tone poems, which attempted to tell a story or depict a landscape using instrumental music.Hanslick and his partisans asserted that instrumental music is simply patterns of sound that do not communicate any emotions or images.Since ancient times, it has been thought that music has the ability to affect our emotions, intellect, and psychology; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions.The Ancient Greek philosopher Plato suggests in The Republic that music has a direct effect on the soul.Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime, music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include lyricism, harmony, hypnotism, emotiveness, temporal dynamics, resonance, playfulness, and color (see also musical development).-- -- 18th century aesthetics of music  -- --
In the 18th century, music was considered so far outside the realm of aesthetic theory (then conceived of in visual terms) that music was barely mentioned in William Hogarth's treatise The Analysis of Beauty.He considered dance beautiful (closing the treatise with a discussion of the minuet), but treated music important only insofar as it could provide the proper accompaniment for the dancers.However, by the end of the century, people began to distinguish the topic of music and its own beauty from music as part of a mixed media, as in opera and dance.Immanuel Kant, whose Critique of Judgment is generally considered the most important and influential work on aesthetics in the 18th century, argued that instrumental music is beautiful but ultimately trivial.Compared to the other fine arts, it does not engage the understanding sufficiently, and it lacks moral purpose.To display the combination of genius and taste that combines ideas and beauty, Kant thought that music must be combined with words, as in song and opera.-- -- 19th century aesthetics of music  -- --
In the 19th century, the era of romanticism in music, some composers and critics argued that music should and could express ideas, images, emotions, or even a whole literary plot.Challenging Kant's reservations about instrumental music, in 1813 E. T. A. Hoffmann argued that music was fundamentally the art of instrumental composition.Five years later, Arthur Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation argued that instrumental music is the greatest art, because it is uniquely capable of representing the metaphysical organization of reality.He felt that because music neither represents the phenomenal world, nor makes statements about it, it bypasses both the pictorial and the verbal.He believed that music was much closer to the true nature of all things than any other art form.This idea would explain why, when the appropriate music is set to any scene, action or event is played, it seems to reveal its innermost meaning, appearing to be the most accurate and distinct commentary of it.Although the Romantic movement accepted the thesis that instrumental music has representational capacities, most did not support Schopenhauer's linking of music and metaphysics.The mainstream consensus endorsed music's capacity to represent particular emotions and situations.
==========
In 1832, composer Robert Schumann stated that his piano work Papillons was "intended as a musical representation" of the final scene of a novel by Jean Paul, Flegeljahre.The thesis that the value of music is related to its representational function was vigorously countered by the formalism of Eduard Hanslick, setting off the "War of the Romantics."This fight divided the aesthetics into two competing groups: On one side are formalists (e.g., Hanslick), who emphasize that the rewards of music are found in appreciation of musical form or design, while on the other side are the anti-formalists, such as Richard Wagner, who regarded musical form as a means to other artistic ends.-- -- 20th century aesthetics of music  -- --
A group of modernist writers in the early 20th century (including the poet Ezra Pound) believed that music was essentially pure because it didn't represent anything, or make reference to anything beyond itself.In a sense, they wanted to bring poetry closer to Hanslick's ideas about the autonomous, self-sufficient character of music.(Bucknell 2002) Dissenters from this view notably included Albert Schweitzer, who argued against the alleged 'purity' of music in a classic work on Bach.Far from being a new debate, this disagreement between modernists and their critics was a direct continuation of the 19th-century debate about the autonomy of music.Among 20th-century composers, Igor Stravinsky is the most prominent composer to defend the modernist idea of musical autonomy.When a composer creates music, Stravinsky claims, the only relevant thing "is his apprehension of the contour of the form, for the form is everything.He can say nothing whatever about meanings" (Stravinsky 1962, p. 115).Although listeners often look for meanings in music, Stravinsky warned that these are distractions from the musical experience.The most distinctive development in the aesthetics of music in the 20th century was that attention was directed at the distinction between 'higher' and 'lower' music, now understood to align with the distinction between art music and popular music, respectively.Theodor Adorno suggested that culture industries churn out a debased mass of unsophisticated, sentimental products that have replaced more 'difficult' and critical art forms that might lead people to actually question social life.False needs are cultivated in people by the culture industries.These needs can be both created and satisfied by the capitalist system, and can replace people's 'true' needs: freedom, full expression of human potential and creativity, and genuine creative happiness.Thus, those trapped in the false notions of beauty according to a capitalist mode of thinking can only hear beauty in dishonest terms (citation necessary).Beginning with Peter Kivy's work in the 1970s, analytic philosophy has contributed extensively to the aesthetics of music.Analytic philosophy pays very little attention to the topic of musical beauty.Instead, Kivy inspired extensive debate about the nature of emotional expressiveness in music.He also contributed to the debate over the nature of authentic performances of older music arguing that much of the debate was incoherent because it failed to distinguish among four distinct standards of authentic performance of music (1995).-- -- 21st century aesthetics of music  -- --
In the 21st century, philosophers such as Nick Zangwill have extended the study of aesthetics in music as studied in the 20th century by scholars such as Jerrold Levinson and Peter Kivy.In his 2014 book on the aesthetics of music titled Music and Aesthetic Reality: Formalism and the Limits of Description, Zangwill introduces his realist position by stating, "By 'realism' about musical experience, I mean a view that foregrounds the aesthetic properties of music and our experience of these properties: Musical experience is an awaremeness of an array of sounds and out the sound structure and its aesthetic properties.This is the content of musical experience."Contemporary music in the 20th and 21st century has had both supporters and detractors.Theodor Adorno in the 20th century was a critic of much popular music.Others in the 21st century, such as Eugene W. Holland, have constructively proposed jazz improvisation as a socio-economic model, and Edward W. Sarath has constructively proposed jazz as a useful paradigm for understanding education and society.-- -- -- Constructive reception  -- -- --
Eugene W. Holland has proposed jazz improvisation as a model for social and economic relations in general.Similarly, Edward W. Sarath has constructively proposed jazz improvisation as a model for change in music, education, and society.-- -- -- Criticism  -- -- --
Simon Frith (2004, p. 17-9) argues that, "'bad music' is a necessary concept for musical pleasure, for musical aesthetics."He distinguishes two common kinds of bad music: the Worst Records Ever Made type, which include "Tracks which are clearly incompetent musically; made by singers who can't sing, players who can't play, producers who can't produce," and "Tracks involving genre confusion.
==========
The most common examples are actors or TV stars recording in the latest style."Another type of "bad music" is "rock critical lists," such as "Tracks that feature sound gimmicks that have outlived their charm or novelty" and "Tracks that depend on false sentiment [...], that feature an excess of feeling molded into a radio-friendly pop song."Frith gives three common qualities attributed to bad music: inauthentic, [in] bad taste (see also: kitsch), and stupid.He argues that "The marking off of some tracks and genres and artists as 'bad' is a necessary part of popular music pleasure; it is a way we establish our place in various music worlds.And 'bad' is a key word here because it suggests that aesthetic and ethical judgements are tied together here: not to like a record is not just a matter of taste; it is also a matter of argument, and argument that matters" (p. 28).Frith's analysis of popular music is based in sociology.Theodor Adorno was a prominent philosopher who wrote on the aesthetics of popular music.A Marxist, Adorno was extremely hostile to popular music.His theory was largely formulated in response to the growing popularity of American music in Europe between World War I and World War II.As a result, Adorno often uses "jazz" as his example of what he believed was wrong with popular music; however, for Adorno this term included everyone from Louis Armstrong to Bing Crosby.He attacked popular music claiming that it is simplistic and repetitive, and encourages a fascist mindset (1973, p. 126).Besides Adorno, Theodore Gracyk provides the most extensive philosophical analysis of popular music.He argues that conceptual categories and distinctions developed in response to art music are systematically misleading when applied to popular music (1996).At the same time, the social and political dimensions of popular music do not deprive it of aesthetic value (2007).In 2007 musicologist and journalist Craig Schuftan published The Culture Club, a book drawing links between modernism art movements and popular music of today and that of past decades and even centuries.His story involves drawing lines between art, or high culture, and pop, or low culture.A more scholarly study of the same topic, Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde, was published five years earlier by philosopher Bernard Gendron.-- -- See also  -- --
